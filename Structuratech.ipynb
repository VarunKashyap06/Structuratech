      "Transcription for Why is Big Data crucial for the construction industry？.mp3:  In today's day and age, there is stupendous amounts of data that is generated every day from countless devices. According to research, 44 quintillion bytes of data were created every day in 2020, and it's estimated that by 2025, there would be 175 zettabytes of data in the global data sphere. Thus, the term big data is vital to understand, learn and manage all the data that is being gathered. Big data can be analyzed for insights that improve decisions. And give confidence for making strategic decisions. For the construction and infrastructure industry, this isn't so different, with Maxwell Geosystems being ideally placed in this area. Big data is used in every stage of the construction process, in order to improve efficiency and productivity. Maxwell Geosystems' cloud-based mission OS is already helping transform the construction and infrastructure industry, throughout all phases of the project. With fast analytics, project engineers are able to connect and immediately start gathering data in real-time. It's smart and highly configurable. Dashboards help combine multiple views of data to gain a richer insight. It further helps reduce environmental impact, where construction data can be integrated into BIM technology to accurately predict how much energy and materials are required for future projects. There is also an improvement in the level of collaboration through accessibility and transparency of information sharing. Companies that utilized big data analytics reported an 8% increase in revenue. By using mission OS, there is a high degree of collaboration through its data loading flexibility, data reporting, and data processing. With the industry moving away from traditional siloed practices, mission OS has become an ideal product in the context sector, for its benefits. Want a free demo?

      "Transcription for New Trends in Concrete Technology.mp3:  Do you think that concrete is boring? It is just a mixture of different materials since early centuries, so what now? Check this out. What are the new trends in concrete technology? Technology and other breakthroughs have had a significant impact on many different sorts of business. The various technologies that are now being developed have an impact on the concrete industry in a very specific way. IoT or Internet of Things The use of technical tools and current Internet applications in the construction process to increase project efficiency is referred to as IoT in construction. To manage and keep an eye on the environment, it makes use of network sensors and actuators. IoT in construction allows for collecting data responsibly. This allows for the use of data responsibly to determine the activity, conditions, performance on the construction site, and transmission of this information to a central dashboard where data is evaluated to help make informed decisions. Here are 10 of the more popular types of IoT sensors with great number of applications and use cases. UHPC or Ultra High Performance Concrete UHPC is a cementitious concrete material with specified durability, tensile ductility, and high performance. It has a minimum required compressive strength of 17,000 pounds per square inch or 120 megapascal. UHPC is also known as reactive powder concrete. Here is an example of the amazing range of material characteristics for UHPC. The world's first LRT system to be constructed with ultra high performance concrete is the Shaughnessy LRT station. UHPC is a cementitious concrete material with specified durability, tensile ductility, and high performance. It is located in Calgary, Canada. While the Mars Hill Bridge in Iowa, United States was the first ultra high performance concrete highway bridge without steel rebars. On February 2022 at the Public Abattoir in Marseille, inaugurated the 19th Century Water Tower Conservation Project using UHPC based on nano elements. Self-Healing Concrete Self-Healing Concrete is a mix integration of chemical reagents, either mineral or synthetic, or bacteria, with the aim to precipitate or produce substances able to fill the cracks that develop upon loads, commonly calcium carbonate. And these bacteria can sleep in the concrete for up to 200 years. Concrete 3D Printing Concrete 3D printing uses extremely large-scale 3D printers, often measuring several meters in height. Concrete 3D printing uses extremely large-scale 3D printers, often measuring several meters in height. and length to extrude a concrete from a nozzle. Almost all 3D printers, regardless of their configuration, constantly extrude a concrete material that resembles dough and is then layered to form the necessary building component. 3D concrete printing technology is in use today for homes, architectural features, and in different areas of construction projects. On November 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On November 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On November 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The world's tallest on-site 3D printed building has been completed.

      "Transcription for How AI is being used in the Construction Industry. - Rise of AI In Construction Industry.mp3:  Hey there, AI enthusiasts! Welcome back to AI Tube, the one-stop destination for everything AI. Today, we'll dive into the fascinating world of AI in the construction industry. Imagine a world where AI-driven robots construct skyscrapers, drones survey construction sites, and software predicts project timelines with impeccable accuracy. Sounds like science fiction? Well, that's the reality in the construction industry today. If you're as excited as we are, don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe for more amazing content. Section 1. How AI is transforming construction management. Did you know? AI is revolutionizing the way construction projects are managed. Let me tell you a story about John, a construction manager who faced multiple delays and failures. He was a construction manager who was working on projects, which was really hard for him to manage. But then, a few years later, John discovered AI-powered construction management software, and his life changed forever. AI-driven construction management software has made project planning, scheduling, and cost estimation a breeze. These intelligent tools analyze past project data to predict project timelines, resource allocation, and potential risks more accurately than any human ever could. For example, software like Alice and Procreate can predict design, cost estimation, and cost allocation of projects. But if you're an AI-driven construction manager, you can't predict the future. The AI-driven construction management software can predict the future. Core harness the power of AI to optimize construction processes, making the lives of construction managers like John much easier. So, what's the takeaway? AI is helping construction managers make data-driven decisions, avoid costly mistakes, and complete projects on time and budget. Section 2. Automating the Design Process with Generative Design. Picture this. An architect struggling to find the perfect design for a new building. Hours spent on drafting and redrafting. But what if I told you that AI could generate hundreds of design options in just minutes? Enter generative design. Generative design is an AI-powered process that rapidly creates multiple design alternatives based on predefined constraints and objectives. For example, Project Refinery by Autodesk is a generative design tool that allows architects to explore various design options, optimize for the best, and create the best design options for their clients. For example, Project Refinery by Autodesk is a generative design tool that allows architects to for energy efficiency and even simulate structural performance. The result? Architects can now focus on creativity and innovation, rather than getting bogged down with technical details. AI is truly revolutionizing the design process in the construction industry. Section 3. The Rise of AI-Driven Construction Robots. Ever heard of SAM, the semi-automated mason? SAM is a bricklaying robot that can lay bricks six times faster than a bricklayer. And it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very impressive, right? But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Construction robots, powered by AI, are becoming increasingly popular on construction sites. They can perform tasks like bricklaying, concrete pouring, and rebar tying with unprecedented speed and precision. And it's not just about efficiency. AI-driven robots also improve safety by performing hazardous tasks that would put human workers at risk. Take, for example, the Tybot by Advanced Construction Robotics, which can autonomously tie rebar on bridge decks, reducing the risk of injury and fatigue for workers. As you can see, AI is not only enhancing productivity but also making construction sites safer for workers. Section 4. Drones and AI – The Perfect Match for Site Inspection Imagine a bird's eye view of your construction site with real-time updates on progress and potential issues. Sounds like a dream? Well, that's exactly what drones equipped with AI can do. Drones can capture high-resolution images and videos of construction sites, while AI algorithms analyze the data to detect problems, monitor progress, and even generate 3D models. Companies like DroneDeploy and SkySee. Section 5. AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance Let me tell you a story about a construction site that experienced a major equipment breakdown, causing massive delays and budget overruns. But then, they started using AI-powered predictive maintenance, and everything changed. Predictive maintenance uses AI algorithms to analyze data from sensors installed on construction equipment, predicting when a machine might fail or require maintenance. This enables construction companies to address issues before they become critical, preventing costly downtime and improving overall productivity. For instance, platforms like Uptake and PreDI provide AI-driven predictive maintenance solutions tailored for the construction industry. The bottom line? AI is helping construction companies save time, money, and resources by optimizing equipment maintenance. Section 6. Virtual and Augmented Reality in Construction Have you ever wished you could visualize your construction project before it's even built? Section 6. Virtual and Augmented Reality in Construction Have you ever wished you could visualize your construction project before it's even built? With AI-powered virtual and augmented reality, VRAR technology is making this possible. With AR-powered digital intelligence, AI allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, VAR technology is making this possible. VAR and AR tools combined with AI allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, make real-time design modifications, and even simulate different construction scenarios. These immersive technologies are transforming the way architects, engineers, and clients collaborate on projects, the way architects, engineers and clients collaborate on projects, reducing errors and enhancing overall productivity. reducing errors and enhancing overall productivity. overall project outcomes. For example, companies like Iris VR and HoloBuilder provide VRAR solutions specifically designed for the construction industry. The result? A more efficient, collaborative, and interactive construction process. Section 7 AI-driven energy efficiency and sustainability In a world increasingly concerned with climate change, the construction industry is turning to AI for sustainable solutions. Let me introduce you to Sarah, an eco-conscious architect who uses AI to create energy-efficient buildings. AI-powered tools like Sefera and Cove tool analyze building designs and suggest improvements to optimize energy usage, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance occupant comfort. These intelligent tools can model various scenarios, such as daylighting, natural ventilation, and energy performance, helping architects like Sarah create truly sustainable, sustainable buildings. The takeaway? AI is playing a crucial role in shaping a greener, more sustainable future for the construction industry. Section 8 3D printing and AI building the future Imagine a world where entire buildings are printed layer by layer like a giant 3D printer. Well, that world is already here, thanks to AI-driven 3D printing technology, AI algorithms optimize 3D printing processes, and AI algorithms optimize 3D printing processes. The world is already here. The world is already here. The world is here. Let's launched upcomports to a live world where AI is estánable. Where the Watford business is vital for the creccalability of the technology represents an onlooker. Section 9. AI-powered safety monitoring. Safety is a top priority in the construction industry, and AI is making construction sites safer than ever before. Let's talk about SiteAware, an AI-driven safety monitoring system that keeps a watchful eye on construction sites. SiteAware uses AI algorithms to analyze video feeds from cameras installed on construction sites, identifying safety hazards and alerting supervisors in real time. This enables construction companies to address potential risks before they become accidents, ensuring a safer working environment for all. In short, AI is playing a crucial role in improving safety standards and reducing accidents in the construction industry. Section 10. Training the next generation of construction professionals. As the construction industry evolves, so does the need for skilled professionals. AI-powered e-learning platforms like SmartVid.io and Interplay Learning are helping train the next generation of construction professionals. These platforms use AI algorithms to create personalized learning paths, interactive simulations, and virtual reality experiences that cater to individual learning styles. This results in a more engaging and effective learning experience, ensuring a safe and safe environment for all. Section 11. Training the next generation of construction professionals. In short, AI is playing a crucial role in improving safety standards, ensuring that construction professionals are well equipped to handle the challenges of an increasingly AI-driven industry. In a nutshell, AI is revolutionizing the way construction professionals are trained, preparing them for a future where technology and human expertise work hand in hand. Section 11. The future of AI in construction. As we look to the future, the potential of AI in the construction industry is limitless. From autonomous construction equipment to intelligent building materials, AI is set to further transform the way we design, build, and maintain our built environment. But what does this mean for the construction workforce? While some fear that AI will replace human jobs, others argue that it will create new opportunities for skilled professionals who can adapt and leverage this technology. One thing is certain, AI will continue to shape the construction industry, and those who embrace it will undoubtedly thrive. Thank you for watching.

      "Transcription for Industrializing Predictive Analytics On Big Data Infrastructure - Laurent Tessier.mp3:  I will introduce myself. I'm an agronomy engineer by design. I have a master's degree in physics and a PhD in applied math. I used to be a scientist as well, on top of a data scientist. I used R. That was a long time ago. I used S plus before using R. Then I quit. I said, no more of that. I don't want to program anymore. This is fun, but not your whole life long. So I became something else, a consultant. Then a company called KXEN hired me as a presales. KXEN was automating predictive analytics. Then that company was acquired by SAP. So that's why I'm there now. But I'm happy. So you know. And well, maybe we can start now. Yes, I think we're ready to go. Okay. Take it away. So are you still searching ROIs in your big data analytics? I think you should read that. That's an interesting post that we have on KD Nuggets at the moment. Okay. But that's true. Many people or many companies had a big data project. They collected data. And now they wonder what they will do with it. And actually, we have customers who come to us and say, well, we have this heap of data. What can we do with it? What are the business problems that we need to solve? The business have no clue about what's in there, actually. Now let's imagine that they have a clue a little bit. Okay? And you know, I took this there was this guy in Paris a couple of years ago. He wanted to find a needle in a haystack. He's a crazy Italian guy. Okay? And he does things like that. And that's a good analogy to what we have to do. We have to find needles in haystacks. Okay? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So we have a big problem, and you cannot burn the A-stack, of course, to get the needles. That's too easy. So we have a big problem, and that big problem is we need to scale. We need to scale to the number of questions that will eventually arise when people understand what is in those data. All the interactions with the people. I could optimize all that. I'm at a manufacturer. I have all the sensor data. I have compliance problems with the production. All that is many, many needles that I need to find. So how do we scale to that? Interestingly, I took this analogy. I took this analogy as well. What is common between the industrial revolution and the evolution of IT? Well, technology first. Without technology, you don't do anything. You don't evolve. Second is you need some raw material you work on. Well, it is data now. It was coal and stuff like that before. And you build something that uses the raw material. And you use that raw material to provide new things. And that was machines at the time. And that's what we have today is computer software. So how do we do that in IT usually? We say, first phase, we develop ad hoc. Great. I have new ideas. I develop something. Okay. It's great. But it's very massive. It's very manual. It's hardly maintainable. You know? I still remember having customers having huge things with ACS. And someone is sick and nobody knows what's going on anymore. Because it's not documented and stuff like that. Okay? And same with R. You know, when I was writing my R code, I was giving it to someone else. He had no clue. Okay. And then we go to tools. Because that's the only way that we will scale. So you have that with ETL. You have that with ERP. You have that with business intelligence. You have that everywhere. So now is the time for data science and predictive analytics. And what do we get from the experience of the other areas like ETL and stuff? Well, interestingly, it doesn't change the size of the teams. And actually, it may even increase the size of the teams. Okay? Much more is done. With usually equal quality. Okay? And we are much more innovative. Because we save time using those tools we can reuse for other things. So, developing new things. And, of course, we provide more value for the company in the end. So... That goes to what we think... What our vision is for predictive analytics at SAP. And it's fairly simple. It's to say... And this is, for me, completely in line with what we see every day. Predictive analytics is something that we will deploy everywhere. And we want that everyone who wants or can or actually maybe will not be aware. But we want to make sure that everyone who wants or can or actually believes in predictive analytics can receive predictive results to optimize the business. And even your customers, you know, I'm a retailer. I will push them predictive results to change their behavior. That's what we want to do. We want to scale out predictive where anyone... Well, we all use weather data today. We want to make sure that we have a predictive factory. We want to make sure that we have a predictive factory that is on everything. It will be on everything. Okay? But for that, we need a predictive factory. So, we need to be able to create, deploy, maintain... I will explain the maintenance part. As many models as we need. To cover the business needs. Okay? To test the performance. So, we need to be able to make sure that we are able to deliver. And that's what we already deliver actually today. So, today, what we have is first, the data is key. Right? We all agree with that. Actually, we all say that 80% of the time we spend is on organizing the data to do the next things about the algorithmics. Okay? Actually, I think in the curses of statisticians and people like that, that's not common. That's not covered enough, but that's another topic. And what we said is, again, the data, if we are in a big data environment where we have collected all that information, should not go out of that environment. We need to be able to transform the data into the data sets we need into that. That means that we will use, well, Hive is slow. But certainly Spark SQL to be able to get the data sets we need whenever we need them. So if you think about what we have with other stuff like BI, it's the logical layer we need to have between the data structure we have in Hive or in Spark and the data sets we need. I'm not talking about the structuration of the data, actually. And I will cover that just... a little bit later. The second part is, if I want to scale, I need to be able, again, to have an automated way of training models. So that's the KXEN technology that SAP acquired, which means that I can take a data set and I have an engine which is robust enough that I will get a predictive model. And I will be able... actually to measure if I can put it in production automatically. And that, of course, with everything running in the Spark environment so that I don't get out any data. Third is, well, we have a problem. All these models, especially when human beings are involved, they're... life expectation is very short. I mean by that, that the changes in the behavior of the people, of the market and so on, means that the results you will get will eventually be completely stupid. So that's something that we absolutely also need to industrialize. And that's what we call... the predictive factory, actually. So the ability with the tool, the two other bricks, to get the data sets whenever we need them and control. And if the control is not good enough, to recalibrate from the whole data set. And third, we need also to be able to deploy. So here we can do the batch deployment, but there are many use cases where we want to deploy. So here we can do the batch deployment, but there are many use cases where we want to deploy. But we want also to be able to deploy real time. And that means today, and we are working on that actually to make it even more easy, And that means today, and we are working on that actually to make it even more easy, that we export code that can be directly embedded, for example, in the Spark stream. So, Java code, for example. Tomorrow, we want even the data manipulation part of that to be exported as one object that can then be embedded into the Spark stream. be embedded into the stream, and the whole data transformation to the probability, for example, will be done at once. You know, predictive in certain ways, if you think about it, is a self-learning ETL process. That's exactly what we are doing here. So, how does it work? Well, the first thing is you have files in HDFS, structured, non-structured, whatever, and you need to structure them. So, that's the part where you work first, of course, because you have to structure all this information into tables views that we can then use. We only use, as of now, structured data. Then, we create this logical layer, which is basically the transformation we want to apply on these tables views to get the data sets we need. And that, as Spark SQL, which gives you the data set. So, imagine you have 1,000 models. You will have 1,000 data sets. They are all different, of course. And that is consumed by the data set. So, we can then use the data set to create the data sets. And that is consumed by the engine we have in Spark to create the model automatically. Of course, there is some communication there with our server, but all that can also be piloted by the predictive factory and also scripting or APIs. You want to embed that into an application, you can use the APIs. It's fully transparent. So, you change all the UI, basically, and you get your own interface to what we can do. So, here, on the native Spark modeling part, what happens is the data is transformed there. There is absolutely no data that goes out. It's all processed locally in Spark. And we only get the stats to be able to report on what was done. So, I said our challenge is scaling. How do we scale? If you take all that back, we say, well, we handle all the technical problems of modeling. Modeling is not a problem anymore. Right? I've built the In a day, more than a thousand models. And I could deploy them. I was okay with that. So all the multicollinearity stuff, the missing data, the outliers, there are technical ways. It's, again, the same thing. We can find a theoretical framework in which this is not a problem. And, of course, if you think about some of the things we do, they come from the 30s where computers didn't exist. So maybe we can change that. Okay. We measure the robustness, of course. And the robustness is about giving you the trust in putting the model in production. So if I have 1,000 models, maybe I'll have some that I have. And then I have to reject and rework. But the vast majority, if I have enough positive cases, I can put in production automatically. Of course, we parallelize the processing. So compared to what I can do today on the server, we divide the training time by 10. And this is expanding again. And this was already fast. And today we support. This is only tested 50,000 columns. We aim at 500,000 columns. Okay. That's a big data problem. And variety of the data means lots of columns. So we can produce those data sets automatically when needed. And that's also what is interesting. It's all embedded. A chain, a process where all the parts are together. And then we have the management of the model. So of course, control whenever you want. And that's again automated. That's tasks you define. Automated recalibration on the whole data set. You started with 500,000. You will recalibrate on 500,000 because you don't know what changed. And maybe all that you had in the previous model is completely gone. Okay. So I will pass that. Let's go to this example. So it's for an airplane manufacturer. So there are not so many in the world. I will not tell you where they come from this way. You have to guess. And it's about quality of production. So one of the challenges they have, of course, is if you have a chain of production with sensors, the first thing is to collect all the data and to put it together. Okay. The second phase is, of course, analyzing. That's maybe the simplest one. And the third part is providing ways for human beings to take decisions or to be alerted and do something. And so they have a cluster with roughly one petabyte of data from five lines of production. When you look at the data that is there, you have roughly 500 sensors per line. And one of the difficulties, of course, is that some provide information at the millisecond. And the second part is that some provide information at the millisecond. And some provide information at the hour. So we have to be able to put all that together in a way which is a coherent way. We have data coming from actually usually SAP systems, for example, work orders for maintenance. Everything is recorded. You know exactly what happened on all the machines, which are on the chain of production. You have all the information, again, from the legacy systems about the spare parts, raw material, origin, quality, everything. You have and you have at the end the quality of what is produced. And that's not at the end. That's at every step of the process, manufacturing process. You have compliance. Is my product that I just built or is this thing that I put are those things that I put together compliant with the quality that is set for that specific step? So you can imagine that that is the challenging way. What we are working at the moment is five different models. OK, it's one on composite. It's one on making composites. And that's all about, you know, temperature, composition of the composites and so on. And there are other things. But what they want from these five is extend to roughly 250 models on that chain of production. OK, and the challenges we have, they are the usual challenges we have. Which are really defining the business problem, clearly defining it in a way that we can express it in terms of data sets. And maybe I will take a minute on that, but that's really the role of the data scientist. OK, the data scientist is the guy who who can understand what business says and transform that into the right data in the right format to get the right result. Which is spot on with the business problem that is asked by the business. Because if you don't do that properly, what happens? You will get well, first you lose credibility because you are providing information which is not the right one. OK, so business say, well, is this crap? You know, they are alerting me when things are right. And then you have a big adoption problem. OK, so. And that is what we learn, OK, really, when we are studying how to transform. How to transform these business questions into predictive things and predictive things are first data sets first. The algorithmics, that's whatever. And then there is a scalability problem again, because here the team is five people. OK, five, so they're going to manage at the end 250 models for this line of production and they will be pulled in other projects. So one of the problem is the definition. And I am afraid I couldn't listen to that part, that presentation earlier about feature definition. But this is crucial. And, you know, I have. A sensor measuring the temperature somewhere. I have a pressure sensor. How do I normalize the way I will transform this data to make it available for all the models I need to build, that's things that we need to define or they need to define in their environment to be able to scale as well. Well. I will try to speak Swedish. So thanks so much. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Transcription for Exploring Green Building and the Future of Construction.mp3:  This episode is brought to you by Brilliant. Click the link in the description below. A lot of focus is put on generating cleaner energy for a sustainable future. But that's just one piece of the puzzle. What if we could dramatically reduce our energy consumption just by changing the way we build our office buildings and skyscrapers? Imagine a skyscraper with smart windows and walls made from fungus. Yes, fungus. Let's explore a green building and the future of construction. And can going net zero really make a difference? I'm Matt Ferrell. Welcome to Undecided. INTRO Building office buildings and skyscrapers with thousands of pounds of concrete, steel, and other materials is a major contributor to pollution and energy use. But it's more than that. Our homes and office buildings' lighting, heating and cooling, poor insulation, and integration into the surrounding environment have a lasting impact on energy use and costs. They require larger amounts of power and water to keep comfortable, which just keeps going on indefinitely. Buildings can count for 20% of the total energy consumption of a building in the next 20 years. But if you're a building that's not a building, you're not going to be able to keep up with the energy consumption. So we're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. We're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. We're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. We need some innovations around how we build our houses, offices, and skyscrapers. This is where net zero and green buildings come in. These constructions are designed and built with the goal of creating a positive impact on the environment and climate. They can combine energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce power consumption, benefit the environment, and improve the quality of life for the people that live and work in those buildings. The concept of green building has been scaling from small houses to big offices and buildings. And that's where we're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. So let's get started. So some international certifications have been developed in order to provide clear guidelines on how to do it. The US Green Building Council developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, also known as LEED, to rate green buildings and provide owners with a framework for cost-saving, high-efficiency, and health for design, construction, operations, and maintenance. Another popular certification is the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method from the UK, also known as BREEAM. Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Who comes up with these acronyms? Well, anyway, zero energy buildings have on-site renewable power sources like solar panels to try to produce as much clean energy as it consumes. You can't always do 100%, but the goal is to get as much as you can. The power generated during the daytime is consumed by the facility itself, and if there's energy surplus, the building delivers that into the grid to try to compensate for grid energy consumption at night. However, to improve efficiency, energy consumption needs need to be reduced. So heating and cooling, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, needs to be minimized. To achieve that, it's recommended to integrate things like green roofs, energy efficient windows with triple-plane glass, and good insulation. Net-zero buildings are also considered green if they're constructed with non-toxic, eco-friendly, and sustainable materials. They should also use less water and have good air quality so it becomes more sustainable. Some of the simplest solutions you may have already seen where you work. A good start to making a building more efficient is using high-efficiency LED and smart lighting, or occupancy sensors hooked up to air conditioning or fan systems. All of those can contribute considerably to reduce energy consumption. But taking things to the next level, engineers and architects can perform advanced analysis through 3D building energy simulation tools to achieve higher efficiencies. Some software like Green Building Studio, EnergyPlus, and IES Energy Modeling enable engineers and architects to improve a green building's design in order to increase their sustainability. They can perform a climate analysis and HVAC simulations to optimize what materials to use and how to orient the building. They can also use the technology to create a green building. If you're interested in learning more about green building, you can check out our video on the Green Building Studio website. They can see exactly how the building will fare throughout the year before it's even built. Examples of green and net-zero buildings have been spreading worldwide over the past decade. In London, for example, Siemens has built the Crystal, one of the greenest buildings in the world. This highly sustainable building is also a unique events venue. It establishes the benchmark for sustainable building design, achieving the Platinum LEED and outstanding BREEAM accreditation, the most rigorous standards for sustainable design. The Crystal is 70% illuminated by natural light, and it's a very good example of how green buildings can be used to create a green building. The solar panels produce 20% of the electricity it uses. Rainwater is collected from the roof and stored in an underground tank for use in the building. 100% of the water that's used in the toilets is taken from non-potable sources just like that. Another interesting feature is the 3500 data points that are used by the Siemens Building Management System to monitor the building's efficiency, which can view water and energy consumption live. The building cost about 30 million pounds in 2012, but saves a lot of money with electricity. Peter Daw, the city's development manager at Siemens, said in terms of CO2 savings, we're saving about 71% compared to an equivalent building. In terms of energy costs, we're saving about 500,000 pounds a year. In Seattle, the Bullitt Center is considered the greenest commercial building in the world. Its structure is mostly composed of heavy timber, and the materials were kept to their natural state to avoid toxins in today's finishes. The wood was sourced locally. The triple-glazed curtain wall, airtight seal, along with the orientation, provides heat control and improved daytime lighting, so the lights are basically off most of the year. In addition, a closed-loop geothermal system meets the heating and cooling load in the office, and an air-to-air heat exchanger provides incoming fresh air from the outside. The Bullitt stores rainwater in a 56,000-gallon cistern in the basement, which is treated and used for non-potable and potable uses, which means they can use it for drinking water. According to Justin Stenkamp, a mechanical engineer with the company that designed the building's control and plumbing systems, these measures alone help to save approximately 80% of the water use over a regular office building. All of that is well and good for building new buildings, but what about existing buildings? One embankment place was built in the early 1990s in London for Price Waterhouse Coopers. It's a great example of zero-energy retrofitting, and today is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It utilizes a tri-generation combined cooling, heat, and power system that's fueled by recycled waste vegetable oil. It also has several spaces to harvest daylight, roof gardens and green walls to make the building more ecological, and low-flush toilets to reduce water use. Currently, the one embankment place emits 40% less carbon than a typical building of its size, and 20% of its heat and 60% of its energy needs are produced on-site. Price Waterhouse Coopers has saved 14 million pounds with energy and carbon related costs. Another retrofitting example is Powerhouse Jorbo, located in Berrum, Norway. I hope I didn't butcher that pronunciation, because I most likely did. These two office buildings from the 80s were retrofitted with efficient ventilation, insulation, and daylight. In addition to producing renewable energy on-site, the energy needs of the buildings have been reduced by more than 86%. As a result, Powerhouse Jorbo received an outstanding classification from Brie M. Noor. And probably the coolest part, the building produces about 230,000 kWh of energy, but only consumes about 100,000 kWh. With new buildings and retrofitting old buildings, what's the forecast of net zero-adaptation? According to one report, the global net zero energy building market share was valued at $896 million in 2018 and is expected to reach $2.1 billion by 2024. That's some serious growth that's being spurred on by not only policy, but the value it drives for building owners. Besides reducing utility bills and zeroing out energy use, it can increase the building's valuation and isolate owners from future energy price variation. On top of that, the benefits also reach out to the people who live and work in the green buildings by experiencing fresh air and enjoying an environment more connected to nature. And there's the positive impact on the environment due to water conservation and energy and material efficiency. So if this is all so great, why is it still a bit unusual to see a green or net zero energy office building? I worked on one for years here in Boston, but they're still hard to come by. The cost of building a zero energy building is higher than constructing a common one because the building materials are usually more expensive. And there still isn't a vast number of designers or builders that are hard to come by. But there's a lot of work to be done to build a green office. So it's a good idea to build a green office building that's highly skilled and experienced in this type of building. Also, high rises have many spaces and occupants in a vertical building with limited roof space for solar panels. So it's difficult for all of them to produce the energy that they consume. A study conducted by the United Kingdom Green Building Council analyzed the feasibility of the design, delivery, and cost of new net zero carbon buildings. In the study, they broke it down into two buckets. For office buildings being built using net zero goals now through 2025, the cost is about 6.2% higher than the cost of building a green office building. The cost is about 6.2% higher than the cost of building a green office building. The cost is about 6.2% higher than standard. Looking further out at newer technologies and standards that are expected to be in the norm by 2030, the cost is 8-17% higher than standard. Some governments are rolling out policies to stimulate net zero or nearly net zero energy buildings. The EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a good example. It established that all new construction must be nearly net zero from December 31, 2020, so everything from now on needs to meet that criteria. Energy performance certificates must be issued when construction is rented or sold and promote smart technologies like building automation and control systems. Then there's the World Green Building Council, which is a group of 70 green building councils from around the world, who have among other initiatives the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This challenges organizations, businesses, cities, states, and regions to all make assets under their direct control, operate at zero carbon by 2030. There are currently 94 businesses and organizations, 28 cities and 6 states and regions participating. By sharing knowledge and lessons learned, the initiative aims to remove the barriers to net zero implementation and inspire others to take action. In addition to green policies, another approach to reduce cost and improve efficiency of net zero buildings are newer technologies and techniques currently being researched, like fungus. Yes, fungus.

So, fungus. How about walls made of plant materials? This is still in the experimental stage, but it uses mycelium, a kind of fungal spore that can be used to fill a form with an agricultural product. The final result is a solid brick or plate. This composite has no toxic chemicals and doesn't take a lot of energy to make. The material could be used as insulation between non-biodegradable materials to avoid breaking apart since it is biodegradable. A project using this material was developed by The Living Studio in New York in cooperation with Ecovative Design. The Hi-Fi project was a tower about 12 meters high, composed of 10,000 bricks made of mushroom mycelium and shredded corn stalks. When the event ended after three months, the structure was dismantled and the bricks decomposed to compost. Exploiting the material was a challenge, but it was worth it. The project was a success, and it was a success. While it's not primarily for net zero reasons, using mycelium to build structures is also being studied by NASA to grow habitats on the Moon and Mars. It has higher bend strength than reinforced concrete, is a great insulator, and can regrow and repair itself. If it's good enough for Martians, why not us? A newer technology that deals with solar radiation and its heat is electrochromic glass . It utilizes nanotechnology, which is something that I covered in a recent video, to produce small electrical signals to slightly charge the windows in order to change the quantity of radiation they reflect. This technology could help control the heat inside a building, which could save a lot of money on HVAC costs, mainly in the summer. Usually smart windows start with a bluish color and after a few minutes turn transparent when you apply electrical charges. Some companies have been producing and improving this technology. For example, View Inc., which is an American smart window company, implemented a project for Netflix's office in Los Gatos, California. They used 56,200 square feet of their smart glass, which uses a predictive automated system that can be customized and controlled through an app. It takes a holistic view of the building, like the arc of the sun or obstructions, to dynamically adjust the tint of the windows. As you can see, there are a lot of different options and techniques out there for improving how we build our buildings and use energy to keep them comfortable. Even though the costs are still not universally affordable for all office and skyscraper owners, the development of new materials, technologies, design improvements, and government incentives can help the growth of this market worldwide. It's pretty easy to imagine high-rise buildings and office parks with green roofs and zero energy popping up in more and more cities in the next few decades. Much like Apple Park, which is the largest LEED Platinum Certified building. Jump into the comments and let me know what you think.

      "Transcription for Green Building Explained.mp3:  Hello friends, Green building is a smart way of constructing buildings that helps protect the environment and keeps people healthy. It involves designing, constructing and maintaining structures in a way that doesn't harm nature and keeps us safe. The goal is to reduce the impact on the environment and make sure people stay well. Green building means constructing buildings in a way that is good for the environment and saves energy and resources. It looks at all parts of the building and managing them to be efficient and not harm the environment. The goal is to create structures that use less energy, use materials wisely and are responsible to the environment. Now let us discuss some key principles and concepts associated with green building. Energy efficiency Green buildings use smart designs to save energy. They choose things like energy-saving appliances, lights and heating or cooling systems. They also like to use renewable energy such as sunlight with solar panels or wind power with turbines. This helps make buildings good for the environment. Sustainable materials Choosing the right materials is really important in green building. We want materials that don't harm the environment when we use them and use them in the right way. The goal is to choose materials that can save all the energy on the environment around us and emit Asbestos Flakes. The one thing is crucial that we safer house than часть of the surrendering energy. By spending more energy on the reforestation and energy-saving office, weはいђу know the best way to reduce carbon by reusing renewable materials. We like to use things that grow back journo. We also like using things that grow quickly so we don't run out of Email services during our work so that we can get back to green timetable. This helps make our buildings better for the Earth. Green building miknow Green building makesisaand�� We äld nicht käën ire ir emperor trial page water conservation Jessica Green takaas Gmail Websites for kgùng où etiñate and cacheł water. This can mean using special plumbing that doesn't waste much water, collecting rainwater, and choosing plants in the garden that don't need a lot of water. It is all about being careful with water so we don't use too much and waste it. Site selection and land use. Green building thinks about how construction affects the environment around it. It cares about saving natural areas, planning land use responsibly, and making sure not to disturb ecosystem too much. Waste reduction. During the construction of a building, a significant amount of waste is generated. But green building tries to make less garbage by using things again and again. They do this by recycling materials. Also, they use clever ways of constructing buildings, like making parts of buildings in a factory and putting them together on site. This helps to minimize the mess during the construction of a building. Indoor environmental quality. Green buildings make sure that people inside them stay healthy and comfortable. They do this by making sure the air you breathe inside is clean, having good ways for air to move around. Like windows and fans, and using materials that are not harmful to your health. This way, living or working in these buildings is good for you and doesn't make you sick. Innovation and technology. Green building uses new technologies and creative ways of building to help the environment. This may include the incorporation of smart building systems, advanced insulation methods, and the use of green infrastructure, like green roofs and permeable pavement. All of these ideas make buildings more eco-friendly and better for the planet. Certification systems. Certification systems like LEED–Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design set rules to check if a building is green. They look at things like how much energy a building uses, how well it saves water, and the impact on it has on the environment. These rules make sure a building meets the standards for being considered environmentally friendly. Green building is like constructing building with a smart plan. It is always changing and getting better with new ideas and tools. The main goal is to build things in a way that helps us now without hurting the world for the people who come after us. It is like finding a balance between what we need today and making sure we don't use up everything so there is enough left for the people of tomorrow. So friends see you in the next video. Thanks for watching.\n",

      "Transcription for 10 Eco-Friendly Building Materials ｜ Sustainable Design.mp3:  This video was sponsored by the Nick Morne Foundation. Concrete and steel production releases tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year, contributing to air pollution and climate change. Fortunately, there are some more sustainable materials which can be used for construction. In this video, we're going to be taking a look at some alternative yet eco-friendly materials, such as seaweed, mushrooms and even coffee, and their practical applications in construction. Formally used as wine stoppers or bulletin boards, in recent years, cork has been found to be one of the most sustainable building materials in the world. With eco-minded construction companies in search of more lightweight, low-cost, sustainable and versatile building materials that not only are aesthetically pleasing, but also effectively insulate and provide long-term protection from the elements, cork ticks all of the boxes. Cork is harvested from a watery, repellent layer of bark on the cork oak tree, mostly grown in the Mediterranean region of South West Europe and Northern Africa. One reason that cork is so sustainable is that no trees actually need to be cut down in order for it to be harvested, and it is easy to recycle. The trees grow for 25 years until their trunks are wide enough, and then the cork can be stripped from them every nine years. Cork oak trees can live up to 300 years, and the older a cork tree is, the better quality the cork that is harvested is. Interconnecting blocks and roof tiles made from cork can provide durability and easy assembly, while also allowing the structure to blend in with its surrounding environment. These are just a few examples of how cork has been used in building homes, hotels, studios and exhibitions around the world. Colombia is one of the world's largest coffee producers, exporting an estimated 15 million bags of coffee beans, not just for coffee. Colombia is one of the world's largest coffee producers, exporting an estimated 15 million bags of coffee beans, not just for coffee. and 2019 alone. Despite the booming business, Colombia is also unfortunately one of the world's most economically disadvantaged countries, with around 35% of its population living in poverty. This has led to many people unable to afford housing, an issue that Bogota-based construction company Woodpecker hopes to solve. By combining coffee husks with recycled plastic, Woodpecker has developed building blocks that link together around a steel frame to create lightweight and easy-to-use buildings. to create lightweight and easy-to-use buildings. The coffee husk is the skin of the coffee bean that dries and falls off during the roasting process, and usually ends up in landfills afterwards. It is stronger and drier than other fibers and allows for these homes, which sell for less than $5,000 each, to be pest and moisture resistant. Nearly 3,000 of Woodpecker's buildings have already been sold, and the company is working alongside the Colombian government to build a new building. and the company is working alongside the Colombian government to build a new building. and the company is working alongside the Colombian government to build a new building. to help house those who have been displaced due to natural disasters. to help house those who have been displaced due to natural disasters. For projects inside the home, Dutch designer Mieke Maier and a team of five have developed newspaper board crispy paper wood an original material adaptable for floorboards, hybrid furniture shelving, concept car interiors and more. Made from sheets of recycled newspaper glued together and layered,餟灰 The pieces are then dried, compacted, sawed and sanded, giving it the look of wood grain. Due to the size and strength limitations of newspaper, newspaper wood is not aiming to act as a large-scale alternative to wood, but it does offer a potential solution to the global paper waste problem. In the UK alone, it is estimated that over 6.3 trillion tonnes of paper are thrown away every year, whereas recycling can save millions of trees. Imagine a material with the potential to be the key to a sustainable future in the fields of fashion, art, food, shipping, construction and more. Mycelium, or the tiny thread-like roots of mushrooms, may just be able to fill these big shoes. It is 100% biodegradable and compostable, yet when dried is strong and durable enough to resist mould, water and fire. In recent years, mycelium has been used for creating eco-conscious packaging materials, meat alternatives and even skin care products. So, what is mycelium? Mycelium is a material that is used to make a material that is not toxic, but is also used to make a material that is not toxic. Now, however, mycelium compressed into bricks is one of the construction industry's most exciting and promising new building materials. Because fungi are living, breathing organisms, they self-regenerate quickly and can assemble themselves into lightweight yet solid objects in a very short time. For more precise or complex projects like insulation, mycelium can be used in 3D printing, making it the ultimate non-toxic building material. Examples of mycelium structures include the high-fiber, the high-fiber, the high-fiber in Queens, New York, the Growing Pavilion in the Netherlands created to showcase how mycelium self-assembles, and the MycoTree project in Seoul, South Korea exhibited to show how mycelium is strong enough to act as an essential structure and support for buildings, while also adding natural beauty to any space. You may think of green algae as something that only grows in your local pond or river, but in Hamburg, Germany, green algae is being used to provide energy for an entire building. The photosynthesis occurs from the production of green algae in the soil and other materials that weren't used to make mycelium. in the algae cells turns the sun's energy into fuel for the building. The algae rapidly grows within the glass panels that cover the entire building where it is then extracted and put into a bioconverter which turns the algae into biomass. This biomass can then be used for a number of things including a source of food for humans or animals and it can also power cars but its greatest ability is that it can generate electricity and heat for those living in the building. When we visited this project in 2019 we were told that the process was actually producing so much energy that it could also power the surrounding buildings too. You can learn more about this and other green projects in our green architecture video here. In the UK alone nearly 3 billion disposable diapers are thrown into landfill each year. To tackle this issue Canadian company No Waste are recycling diapers and other absorbent sanitary products into roof tiles. The recycling process sanitizes the waste to create two different materials. Firstly they remove the organic fibers and use them for green energy and paper while secondly they extract the plastic binding these sanitary products to recycle into a variety of other products including plastic cladding, decking and roof tiles. Sending these otherwise disposable products to the No Waste facility will save the same amount of space in the UK's landfills as 96 other disposable products. Another zusammen CEO proposes to use these AsOnL правdrom announce that NO Waves League will be involved in theät karma gas at a gas station in order to save lives. While they are still recycling as a result of their work trying to stop bad heating, gas is clean going off cement belt was where It is one of the most eco-friendly materials of all the examples mentioned in this video, as the materials for construction can be found on the site of construction rather than needing to be imported from elsewhere. It is also, in my opinion, the best looking material, as Cobb allows you to easily create unique home styles, curves and furniture built directly into the walls. Indian engineer Nizambi Maté discovered that Nairobi's plastic waste pollution was becoming a serious problem. Nairobi produces over 500 metric tonnes of plastic waste every single day, but less than 9% of the city's plastic waste was being recycled. Instead of waiting for the government to do something, Maté took action. Machines that Maté designed herself mixed plastic and sand together at high temperatures, where the plastic when melted acts as a binder. The mixture is then mixed with the plastic and sand together. The mixture is then mixed with the plastic and sand together at high temperatures, where the plastic when melted acts as a binder. The mixture is then mixed with the plastic and sand together at high temperatures, where the plastic when melted acts as a binder. The mixture is then compressed into bricks that are stronger than concrete and lighter too, which helps cut costs and shipping, and makes their use in buildings less labour intensive. Looking towards the future, there is no limit to what Maté hopes to achieve. Seeking investors across Africa to scale her business for the whole continent, Maté hopes to pave the way for upcycling efforts around the world. Plant based polyurethane rigid foam is manufactured from materials like kelp, hemp, and tin. It is highly resistant to moisture and heat and offers protection against mould and pests. In addition to being considered more eco-friendly, some types of plant based foam have actually been shown to improve insulation, thermal resistance, and be better protection against issues that often plague homes using typical insulation materials. On the island of Laisu, located off the coast of Denmark, homes made with roofs of seaweed, etc. are being made with more than 300 years old. Apart from their humongous size, they look a lot like thatch, but seaweed is far more durable and it reproduces itself every year in the sea and comes ashore without any effort from humans. It is then dried on nearby fields by sun and wind, and easily carried to building sites due to its light weight. A more modern example of seaweed use in construction are these seaweed pillows which were used as cladding for a home designed by the Copenhagen municipality. Some of the most popular and popular materials used in construction are the windbreaker, the Hagen architecture firm Van Kusten. Their aim was to design a new house that combines traditional materials with 21st century construction techniques.

      "Transcription for Varun Bhartiya's live session at DCW 2024 on how AI is shaping the Future of Construction.mp3:  In order to adopt AI, I think there's also a change of mindset required. Every company is using AI for certain bits and pieces. It is maturing slowly. So we have to, for significant period of time, work in collaboration with AI. This episode is recorded live at Digital Construction Week at the Excel in London, where I interviewed some of the best and brightest in the built environment for a revealing look at innovation and technology. Varun Bhatia is the co-founder and CEO of EncircleTech, a company at the forefront of empowering passionate innovators in the architecture, engineering, construction and manufacturing industry, providing disruptive solutions that reduce time to market and exceed business goals. From Varun's early days blending coding and 3D visualizations, along with the integration of AI, machine learning and other groundbreaking technologies, EncircleTech has collaborated with over 75 software companies and successfully developed over 200 client projects. Varun has been recognized as an inventor, technologist, entrepreneur and visionary leader in the industry. Varun has been a leading entrepreneur in the field of 3D design and visualization automation for more than 15 years, and he's now seen as a thought leader and innovator deeply involved with AI, who is driven by his passion for helping companies unlock the transformative potential of AI in the construction industry and how AI can accelerate construction processes to make them better, smarter and faster. I can think of no better person to discuss this with than Varun. Varun, welcome to the podcast. Thank you. So I'm going to start by looking at your company and getting your view on where EncircleTech is today. You've been going for 12 years and have expanded your global footprint in Japan, UK, and the world. And I'm sure you've had a lot of fun with the technology you're using. What are some of the things that you've learned from the technology you're using? I think the first thing is that you're going to be able to do a lot of things. You're going to be able to do a lot of things in the UK, Korea, Canada and the likes. And you have over 250 employees. That's impressive. And you serve more than 100 clients. Wow. In your own words, what does EncircleTech look like right now? So EncircleTech is at an intersection of BIM knowledge, AEC knowledge, software development expertise and AI ML. We bring these three skill sets together to build a team. We have a team of engineers who are going to help innovators in the construction space build great solutions and supercharge the construction, which is the need of the hour. Every industry, every, I mean, as you can see in DCW right here, there are so many companies innovating. Yeah. And they need more and more workforce who can kind of build these solutions with the right expertise. Over the last 12 years, we've been building solutions for over 100 companies. We've enjoyed the expertise that we bring in. In terms of how a product should be designed, which technologies are supposed to be used. We often find a lot of customers making the wrong choice of technology. Okay. And then trying to fix that long term with our expertise. So that's the expertise that we bring in as an automation for all these companies. Okay. It's interesting that you said getting the right technology. Because I think that's the key. Yeah. And that's absolutely critical. And where some organizations struggle is they just want a solution. And it's no, no, no, you don't want a solution. You want the right solution. Right solution. Absolutely. Excellent. So let's talk a little bit broader. And like you rightly said, as you can see all around us at Digital Construction Week, the UK construction industry isn't short of digital tools and innovation, large and small. Can you share some insights and best practices organizations need to adopt to keep people engaged? Can you share some of the things that they need to adopt to keep pace with the rapid change of technology that's currently occurring? What should they be looking to do? I think in today's world, as we all know and probably have realized, it is very important to make all the decisions based on data. But if you look at it from what is actually happening in the industry, data has to be extracted from BIM models, from the data that's being used in the industry. Extracted from BIM models, from ERP systems, from 100 other sources. And by the time that data is presented to any decision maker, it's practically two to four week old data because a lot of that is manual. Now, imagine you don't even want to read a newspaper that is one day old. Absolutely. And here we are talking about making large organization decisions based on two week old data. Wow. How bad is that? Yeah, for sure. We are creating solutions that is fast tracking this process, making data accessible in dashboards in right form and in a near real time manner. Because with specifically data, you don't even want copies of data. These days what happens, unfortunately, the construction industry has so many tools. You have your files in one system. You use another system for one particular operation and third system for something else. Or even a spreadsheet. And still spreadsheets have not been discarded yet. They continue to exist for whatever long you have. Yeah, absolutely. But the problem with all this is there is duplication and the data goes out of sync. You can't keep all the data in sync with each other. So you're making decisions which is old data. You're making decisions on the data which means new data. You're making decisions on the data which may not be in the sync with all other systems. We need to fix this problem. And that's the solution. We are building connectors, bringing data from all your systems into various dashboards, Power BI or whatever people want to look at. I love that answer. When you were talking about a newspaper, I was thinking of a shopping list and using one that was four weeks old to go and get you shopping. I mean, how crazy is that? How crazy. Like you said. It's like a million pound organization. It's not a quick trip to Tesco. Exactly. I mean, and you still, I mean, leadership are, I mean, I have been in a leadership position. See, when I talk to my organization based on an old data, even if I'm making someone accountable, they always have an excuse. Oh, you know, that was the case two weeks back, but now it has changed. And then when you're dragging what is the status today? I think it's the same thing. You can't just drag your data again to make up for the information. You just can't catch up with the system. So it is very, very crucial that your data has to be very accurate and near real time to make and people are doing it. And if you are not doing it in your organization, you're likely to be left behind. Okay. That's excellent. Excellent advice. So. Ben, CircleTech has collaborated with over 75 software companies and successfully developed over 200 client projects to date. That's impressive. Could you share some successful case studies or examples where your tailored solutions have improved project outcomes while streamlining workflows successfully? Sure. So we work with one of the largest shared office space provider, co-working space provider. You can imagine. They had 500 plus office buildings spread across the globe, trying to make sense of all this data at one place. Again, similar. I mean, in this space, it is very difficult to compare one building to another. Some of them may have more hot desk. Some of them may have lesser hot desk. Some of them may have larger pantry and common area and some of them less. But you need to identify how to compare all these. Okay. So you need to identify how to compare all these properties and what changes you need to make in each of these properties to maximize your return. They had no clue of how to visualize all this data together. We were able to pull all their data from ACC, BIM 360 data directly from the BIM model because we also found that in some cases, again, the problem was duplication of data. Okay. So we had duplication of data when you put it in spreadsheet. You accidentally type 40 instead of 4 in a conference room, which is 10 by 10. You can never fit that many people, that many chairs in a conference room that small, but it happens. Yeah. So you need data directly from the BIM models representing you the actual use case. And it has to be real time. We were able to present those that go to the CEO of the organization, which helped them fix data. Which helped them fix leakage in their systems and thus become profitable, even get to an IPO with profitable growing story. So that's the outcome and that's the benefit of data that we bring in. That's amazing. That's a great example. Absolutely fantastic. Just moving on a little bit, I'm going to take a quote directly from your website here stating that McKinsey reported that AI possesses the potential to deliver an additional additional level of data. So it's a great example of how AI can deliver an additional estimated economic activity of $13 trillion by the year 2030. Coining the phrase, the fourth industrial revolution. But it doesn't look like being that easy to deploy and it shouldn't really. It's new technology. So where are the concerns around AI implementation and are we actually ready for this? Very interesting question. I know AI and ML has been the buzzword. And it's a big one. Yeah. Everyone is talking about it. And there's no everyone. Probably if you visit every exhibit here, everyone has some component of AI in their offering. Yeah. But it is also important to understand in order to adopt AI, I think there's also a change of mindset required. Yes. Every company is using AI for certain bits and pieces. And AI is maturing slowly. So we have to for significant period of time, we have to work in collaboration with AI. Okay. Even today, when all this chat GPT, LAMA models, everything has been coming up, you have to imagine that they are not making it public for like reliable information. Okay. As soon as it comes, they do have a disclaimer that they are not making it public for reliable information. And I think they will come up with a disclaimer that they are not making it public for value. Yeah. Because they do have a disclaimer that this is AI generated and you have to interpret your own options. So when companies are adopting in construction, they are adopting AI and ML. My advice or my recommendation here is first ask the question, are you okay with 90 to 95% accuracy? Is your team ready to work in collaboration with AI and ML? Because I often find companies doing a switch, but then they don't want to do that. I would say, for example, like, I think in a company like B2B, it is very difficult to just say, I'm going to do this. So it's not something that I would do. I'm going to do that. So it's not something that I would do. I'm going to do that. But I think it's not something that I would do. First, ask the question, are you okay with 90 to 95% accuracy? Is your team ready to work in collaboration with AI and effort? Because I often find companies doing a switch, but then as soon as we bring in the AI component, the team says, oh, then AI is supposed to do 100%. Yeah, of course. Otherwise, I won't adopt it. So it's like they're really comparing it as a replacement of and it is being treated like that. Yeah, that stage will come or so but it takes time. The true potential of AI is collaboration with humans. I mean, humans have to understand they are assisting us. I mean, AI is assisting me in doing my work more efficiently. So pick problem statements where you can reduce the number of options. Let's say you have 1000 issues. 1000 options. Can you reduce it down to five most important ones? That's where the value of AI can really be important and value adding. Any use cases which are which require 100% accuracy are going to be a long gamble, because it takes a whole lot of time to build the solutions. And then meeting that 100 or near 100% accuracy takes a lot of time. So I think that's where the value of AI is going to be. Yeah, sure. I get that. And that's, it's so crucial to remember that we're still still part of this. We're still involved in this, you know. Let's look a little bit more internally than at nCircleTech. So machine learning and AI can certainly make admin tasks more efficient within any sector, specifically construction. A 2017 McKinsey report stated that construction firms could boost productivity by as much as 50% through real time. And that's a lot of data. So we're still looking at that. And we're still looking at the real time analysis of data, which nCircleTech does fantastically. Although it was published seven years ago, I'm pretty sure the percentages will have increased in 50%. It's probably 60, 70, 80. But if we look internally, how are you and nCircleTech using machine learning and AI? We in nCircle, we build solutions that fast track our end to end offering with a lot of companies. We operate by understanding their process, replicating that first manually, and then optimizing it on day to day basis with automations. So let's take an example of scan to BIM. We are building our own solution, which is machine learning based, trying to first identify components from the point cloud data, because that also adds a lot of value to a lot of companies. Segment the point cloud data and then create BIM models all automatically from the BIM data. I mean, from the point cloud data. There are many use cases, not just internally, but we have worked on many use cases with our customers. One of our customers is into buying old properties where undervalue and old constructed hundred year old house exists, which is underperforming, not energy efficient, replacing that with the state of the art house with all the modern and new. So that's where we're going to be. Our target company is likeнизIt We're looking for mistakes, for clothing that utilize A lot of reproduce of prusalem標 Stress aren't clear from this specific approach, but we're active on the market in this organization. S nuclear and nuclear power plants need control lip. Unlike most other governments, nuclear power plants do not need control lip. Policy. give you maximum roi they are currently most undervalued as compared to the vicinity but delivering maximum value once it is upgraded with latest house so definitely different use cases from our scan to bim solutions to this property identification to even competitive analysis i mean companies are investing in competitive analysis because you can't go after every rfp that is thrown at you you want to prioritize if ai can help you screen 100 rfps and probably bring it down to five that you need to really invest into yeah and then that's where the human element comes in and you make that decision that's when you win but if you use ai to say can i go after this rfp yes or no not that it becomes a gamble it becomes a gamble and you don't want that to happen yeah absolutely fantastic so looking towards the future then as technology continues to evolve how do you foresee the future of card and bim software developing in construction um i think data is becoming more and more gold mine for everyone gone are the days when most of these bim and cad companies were protecting their data and they were using the proprietary formats i think we all see a shift that all these companies are now open to exchange of data because every other company is using mix of tools to work with their data yeah we've seen a lot of government organizations not wanting to pay for access to their data because and companies have made money charging all these organizations just for the access of data so i think uh it is time the big change that is going to happen is more exchange of data a very high degree of interoperability people have realized that this is going to be a bold mine and is a bold money uh some companies are working on organizing this data internally better because they have executed hundreds of projects in the past and their data is not in the consumable format yeah and very next after this is the ai is going to be the key to that world mind because humanly it becomes humanly impossible to yeah all this data and ai can help you really unlock its full potential yeah so i think my feedback or my bet is on how ai and data is going to transform this industry quite yeah yeah i mean we're not short of data are we we're not short of data we love it right we're just getting back into consumer Transformation to to to deliver the right outcomes and um yeah I I a huge fan of of what you're doing at the moment I think it's it's it's really uh interesting our customers enjoy the right consultancy that we bring in the right uh guidance because every time you don't have so much bandwidth to invest or stewardship of data or customer models, what are you trying to do then? yeah we have GOD liberal agency and they are very marshall has a security and security role and or bring people in house, research on all these topics. We bring this expertise from global development and this fast track go to market for our customers. Fantastic. So final question from me, we're here at Digital Construction Week. Just give us your thoughts about the event. I think this year the event has been very enthusiastic, very energetic. I think very huge participation as compared to past events that I have attended. Very happy with the footfall and the conversations that are happening. Just as an advice, if I can give you, I think all of us are getting bombarded with lot of solutions out there. And there is a sense of being overcautious about adopting anything. People are always evaluating and they are always evaluating. They are always evaluating things with a sense of suspicion that will this work or will this not work or whatever. But I think I would encourage to go with open mindset. There are many hidden gems out here. If you go with an open mindset, have some bandwidth to experiment, I think they're going to add a lot of value. Yeah. Construction industry is always in this catch up game. When they have money, they don't have time to innovate. When they have time, they don't have money to innovate. For sure. So we need to find some time and money to experiment and always keep innovating. Absolutely. Excellent advice. Excellent advice. Varun, thank you so much for coming out. It's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you. Thank you for having me. And it was a pleasure talking to you.\n",

      "Transcription for New Trends in Concrete Technology.mp3:  Do you think that concrete is boring? It is just a mixture of different materials since early centuries, so what now? Check this out. What are the new trends in concrete technology? Technology and other breakthroughs have had a significant impact on many different sorts of business. The various technologies that are now being developed have an impact on the concrete industry in a very specific way. IoT or Internet of Things The use of technical tools and current Internet applications in the construction process to increase project efficiency is referred to as IoT in construction. To manage and keep an eye on the environment, it makes use of network sensors and actuators. IoT in construction allows for collecting data responsibly. This allows for the use of data responsibly to determine the activity, conditions, performance on the construction site, and transmission of this information to a central dashboard where data is evaluated to help make informed decisions. Here are 10 of the more popular types of IoT sensors with great number of applications and use cases. UHPC or Ultra High Performance Concrete UHPC is a cementitious concrete material with specified durability, tensile ductility, and high performance. It has a minimum required compressive strength of 17,000 pounds per square inch or 120 megapascal. UHPC is also known as reactive powder concrete. Here is an example of the amazing range of material characteristics for UHPC. The world's first LRT system to be constructed with ultra high performance concrete is the Shaughnessy LRT station. UHPC is a cementitious concrete material with specified durability, tensile ductility, and high performance. It is located in Calgary, Canada. While the Mars Hill Bridge in Iowa, United States was the first ultra high performance concrete highway bridge without steel rebars. On February 2022 at the Public Abattoir in Marseille, inaugurated the 19th Century Water Tower Conservation Project using UHPC based on nano elements. Self-Healing Concrete Self-Healing Concrete is a mix integration of chemical reagents, either mineral or synthetic, or bacteria, with the aim to precipitate or produce substances able to fill the cracks that develop upon loads, commonly calcium carbonate. And these bacteria can sleep in the concrete for up to 200 years. Concrete 3D Printing Concrete 3D printing uses extremely large-scale 3D printers, often measuring several meters in height. Concrete 3D printing uses extremely large-scale 3D printers, often measuring several meters in height. and length to extrude a concrete from a nozzle. Almost all 3D printers, regardless of their configuration, constantly extrude a concrete material that resembles dough and is then layered to form the necessary building component. 3D concrete printing technology is in use today for homes, architectural features, and in different areas of construction projects. On November 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On November 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On November 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The world's tallest on-site 3D printed building has been completed. It is a three-story 345-square-meter house, with a total height of 9.9 meters. Light-emitting cement A green building material called light-emitting cement can be used to illuminate bicycle lanes, roadways, and highways without the use of electricity. Light-emitting cement absorbs solar energy during the day and radiates light at night. Light-emitting cement absorbs solar energy during the day and radiates light at night. It is a combination of sand, alkali, silica, industrial waste, water and some additives added to convert the material to a phosphorescent material that absorbs solar energy and releases it in the form of light.

Let me tell you a story about John, a construction manager who faced multiple delays and failures. He was a construction manager who was working on projects, which was really hard for him to manage. But then, a few years later, John discovered AI-powered construction management software, and his life changed forever. AI-driven construction management software has made project planning, scheduling, and cost estimation a breeze. These intelligent tools analyze past project data to predict project timelines, resource allocation, and potential risks more accurately than any human ever could. For example, software like Alice and Procreate can predict design, cost estimation, and cost allocation of projects. But if you're an AI-driven construction manager, you can't predict the future. The AI-driven construction management software can predict the future. Core harness the power of AI to optimize construction processes, making the lives of construction managers like John much easier. So, what's the takeaway? AI is helping construction managers make data-driven decisions, avoid costly mistakes, and complete projects on time and budget. Section 2. Automating the Design Process with Generative Design. Picture this. An architect struggling to find the perfect design for a new building. Hours spent on drafting and redrafting. But what if I told you that AI could generate hundreds of design options in just minutes? Enter generative design. Generative design is an AI-powered process that rapidly creates multiple design alternatives based on predefined constraints and objectives. For example, Project Refinery by Autodesk is a generative design tool that allows architects to explore various design options, optimize for the best, and create the best design options for their clients. For example, Project Refinery by Autodesk is a generative design tool that allows architects to for energy efficiency and even simulate structural performance. The result? Architects can now focus on creativity and innovation, rather than getting bogged down with technical details. AI is truly revolutionizing the design process in the construction industry. Section 3. The Rise of AI-Driven Construction Robots. Ever heard of SAM, the semi-automated mason? SAM is a bricklaying robot that can lay bricks six times faster than a bricklayer. And it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very impressive, right? But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Construction robots, powered by AI, are becoming increasingly popular on construction sites. They can perform tasks like bricklaying, concrete pouring, and rebar tying with unprecedented speed and precision. And it's not just about efficiency. AI-driven robots also improve safety by performing hazardous tasks that would put human workers at risk. Take, for example, the Tybot by Advanced Construction Robotics, which can autonomously tie rebar on bridge decks, reducing the risk of injury and fatigue for workers. As you can see, AI is not only enhancing productivity but also making construction sites safer for workers. Section 4. Drones and AI – The Perfect Match for Site Inspection Imagine a bird's eye view of your construction site with real-time updates on progress and potential issues. Sounds like a dream? Well, that's exactly what drones equipped with AI can do. Drones can capture high-resolution images and videos of construction sites, while AI algorithms analyze the data to detect problems, monitor progress, and even generate 3D models. Companies like DroneDeploy and SkySee. Section 5. AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance Let me tell you a story about a construction site that experienced a major equipment breakdown, causing massive delays and budget overruns. But then, they started using AI-powered predictive maintenance, and everything changed. Predictive maintenance uses AI algorithms to analyze data from sensors installed on construction equipment, predicting when a machine might fail or require maintenance. This enables construction companies to address issues before they become critical, preventing costly downtime and improving overall productivity. For instance, platforms like Uptake and PreDI provide AI-driven predictive maintenance solutions tailored for the construction industry. The bottom line? AI is helping construction companies save time, money, and resources by optimizing equipment maintenance. Section 6. Virtual and Augmented Reality in Construction Have you ever wished you could visualize your construction project before it's even built? Section 6. Virtual and Augmented Reality in Construction Have you ever wished you could visualize your construction project before it's even built? With AI-powered virtual and augmented reality, VRAR technology is making this possible. With AR-powered digital intelligence, AI allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, VAR technology is making this possible. VAR and AR tools combined with AI allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, allow construction professionals to explore 3D models, make real-time design modifications, and even simulate different construction scenarios. These immersive technologies are transforming the way architects, engineers, and clients collaborate on projects, the way architects, engineers and clients collaborate on projects, reducing errors and enhancing overall productivity. reducing errors and enhancing overall productivity. overall project outcomes. For example, companies like Iris VR and HoloBuilder provide VRAR solutions specifically designed for the construction industry. The result? A more efficient, collaborative, and interactive construction process. Section 7 AI-driven energy efficiency and sustainability In a world increasingly concerned with climate change, the construction industry is turning to AI for sustainable solutions. Let me introduce you to Sarah, an eco-conscious architect who uses AI to create energy-efficient buildings. AI-powered tools like Sefera and Cove tool analyze building designs and suggest improvements to optimize energy usage, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance occupant comfort. These intelligent tools can model various scenarios, such as daylighting, natural ventilation, and energy performance, helping architects like Sarah create truly sustainable, sustainable buildings. The takeaway? AI is playing a crucial role in shaping a greener, more sustainable future for the construction industry. Section 8 3D printing and AI building the future Imagine a world where entire buildings are printed layer by layer like a giant 3D printer. Well, that world is already here, thanks to AI-driven 3D printing technology, AI algorithms optimize 3D printing processes, and AI algorithms optimize 3D printing processes. The world is already here. The world is already here. The world is here. Let's launched upcomports to a live world where AI is estánable. Where the Watford business is vital for the creccalability of the technology represents an onlooker. Section 9. AI-powered safety monitoring. Safety is a top priority in the construction industry, and AI is making construction sites safer than ever before. Let's talk about SiteAware, an AI-driven safety monitoring system that keeps a watchful eye on construction sites. SiteAware uses AI algorithms to analyze video feeds from cameras installed on construction sites, identifying safety hazards and alerting supervisors in real time. This enables construction companies to address potential risks before they become accidents, ensuring a safer working environment for all. In short, AI is playing a crucial role in improving safety standards and reducing accidents in the construction industry. Section 10. Training the next generation of construction professionals. As the construction industry evolves, so does the need for skilled professionals. AI-powered e-learning platforms like SmartVid.io and Interplay Learning are helping train the next generation of construction professionals. These platforms use AI algorithms to create personalized learning paths, interactive simulations, and virtual reality experiences that cater to individual learning styles. This results in a more engaging and effective learning experience, ensuring a safe and safe environment for all. Section 11. Training the next generation of construction professionals. In short, AI is playing a crucial role in improving safety standards, ensuring that construction professionals are well equipped to handle the challenges of an increasingly AI-driven industry. In a nutshell, AI is revolutionizing the way construction professionals are trained, preparing them for a future where technology and human expertise work hand in hand. Section 11. The future of AI in construction. As we look to the future, the potential of AI in the construction industry is limitless. From autonomous construction equipment to intelligent building materials, AI is set to further transform the way we design, build, and maintain our built environment. But what does this mean for the construction workforce? While some fear that AI will replace human jobs, others argue that it will create new opportunities for skilled professionals who can adapt and leverage this technology. One thing is certain, AI will continue to shape the construction industry, and those who embrace it will undoubtedly thrive. Thank you for watching.

      "Transcription for Industrializing Predictive Analytics On Big Data Infrastructure - Laurent Tessier.mp3:  I will introduce myself. I'm an agronomy engineer by design. I have a master's degree in physics and a PhD in applied math. I used to be a scientist as well, on top of a data scientist. I used R. That was a long time ago. I used S plus before using R. Then I quit. I said, no more of that. I don't want to program anymore. This is fun, but not your whole life long. So I became something else, a consultant. Then a company called KXEN hired me as a presales. KXEN was automating predictive analytics. Then that company was acquired by SAP. So that's why I'm there now. But I'm happy. So you know. And well, maybe we can start now. Yes, I think we're ready to go. Okay. Take it away. So are you still searching ROIs in your big data analytics? I think you should read that. That's an interesting post that we have on KD Nuggets at the moment. Okay. But that's true. Many people or many companies had a big data project. They collected data. And now they wonder what they will do with it. And actually, we have customers who come to us and say, well, we have this heap of data. What can we do with it? What are the business problems that we need to solve? The business have no clue about what's in there, actually. Now let's imagine that they have a clue a little bit. Okay? And you know, I took this there was this guy in Paris a couple of years ago. He wanted to find a needle in a haystack. He's a crazy Italian guy. Okay? And he does things like that. And that's a good analogy to what we have to do. We have to find needles in haystacks. Okay? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So we have a big problem, and you cannot burn the A-stack, of course, to get the needles. That's too easy. So we have a big problem, and that big problem is we need to scale. We need to scale to the number of questions that will eventually arise when people understand what is in those data. All the interactions with the people. I could optimize all that. I'm at a manufacturer. I have all the sensor data. I have compliance problems with the production. All that is many, many needles that I need to find. So how do we scale to that? Interestingly, I took this analogy. I took this analogy as well. What is common between the industrial revolution and the evolution of IT? Well, technology first. Without technology, you don't do anything. You don't evolve. Second is you need some raw material you work on. Well, it is data now. It was coal and stuff like that before. And you build something that uses the raw material. And you use that raw material to provide new things. And that was machines at the time. And that's what we have today is computer software. So how do we do that in IT usually? We say, first phase, we develop ad hoc. Great. I have new ideas. I develop something. Okay. It's great. But it's very massive. It's very manual. It's hardly maintainable. You know? I still remember having customers having huge things with ACS. And someone is sick and nobody knows what's going on anymore. Because it's not documented and stuff like that. Okay? And same with R. You know, when I was writing my R code, I was giving it to someone else. He had no clue. Okay. And then we go to tools. Because that's the only way that we will scale. So you have that with ETL. You have that with ERP. You have that with business intelligence. You have that everywhere. So now is the time for data science and predictive analytics. And what do we get from the experience of the other areas like ETL and stuff? Well, interestingly, it doesn't change the size of the teams. And actually, it may even increase the size of the teams. Okay? Much more is done. With usually equal quality. Okay? And we are much more innovative. Because we save time using those tools we can reuse for other things. So, developing new things. And, of course, we provide more value for the company in the end. So... That goes to what we think... What our vision is for predictive analytics at SAP. And it's fairly simple. It's to say... And this is, for me, completely in line with what we see every day. Predictive analytics is something that we will deploy everywhere. And we want that everyone who wants or can or actually maybe will not be aware. But we want to make sure that everyone who wants or can or actually believes in predictive analytics can receive predictive results to optimize the business. And even your customers, you know, I'm a retailer. I will push them predictive results to change their behavior. That's what we want to do. We want to scale out predictive where anyone... Well, we all use weather data today. We want to make sure that we have a predictive factory. We want to make sure that we have a predictive factory that is on everything. It will be on everything. Okay? But for that, we need a predictive factory. So, we need to be able to create, deploy, maintain... I will explain the maintenance part. As many models as we need. To cover the business needs. Okay? To test the performance. So, we need to be able to make sure that we are able to deliver. And that's what we already deliver actually today. So, today, what we have is first, the data is key. Right? We all agree with that. Actually, we all say that 80% of the time we spend is on organizing the data to do the next things about the algorithmics. Okay? Actually, I think in the curses of statisticians and people like that, that's not common. That's not covered enough, but that's another topic. And what we said is, again, the data, if we are in a big data environment where we have collected all that information, should not go out of that environment. We need to be able to transform the data into the data sets we need into that. That means that we will use, well, Hive is slow. But certainly Spark SQL to be able to get the data sets we need whenever we need them. So if you think about what we have with other stuff like BI, it's the logical layer we need to have between the data structure we have in Hive or in Spark and the data sets we need. I'm not talking about the structuration of the data, actually. And I will cover that just... a little bit later. The second part is, if I want to scale, I need to be able, again, to have an automated way of training models. So that's the KXEN technology that SAP acquired, which means that I can take a data set and I have an engine which is robust enough that I will get a predictive model. And I will be able... actually to measure if I can put it in production automatically. And that, of course, with everything running in the Spark environment so that I don't get out any data. Third is, well, we have a problem. All these models, especially when human beings are involved, they're... life expectation is very short. I mean by that, that the changes in the behavior of the people, of the market and so on, means that the results you will get will eventually be completely stupid. So that's something that we absolutely also need to industrialize. And that's what we call... the predictive factory, actually. So the ability with the tool, the two other bricks, to get the data sets whenever we need them and control. And if the control is not good enough, to recalibrate from the whole data set. And third, we need also to be able to deploy. So here we can do the batch deployment, but there are many use cases where we want to deploy. So here we can do the batch deployment, but there are many use cases where we want to deploy. But we want also to be able to deploy real time. And that means today, and we are working on that actually to make it even more easy, And that means today, and we are working on that actually to make it even more easy, that we export code that can be directly embedded, for example, in the Spark stream. So, Java code, for example. Tomorrow, we want even the data manipulation part of that to be exported as one object that can then be embedded into the Spark stream. be embedded into the stream, and the whole data transformation to the probability, for example, will be done at once. You know, predictive in certain ways, if you think about it, is a self-learning ETL process. That's exactly what we are doing here. So, how does it work? Well, the first thing is you have files in HDFS, structured, non-structured, whatever, and you need to structure them. So, that's the part where you work first, of course, because you have to structure all this information into tables views that we can then use. We only use, as of now, structured data. Then, we create this logical layer, which is basically the transformation we want to apply on these tables views to get the data sets we need. And that, as Spark SQL, which gives you the data set. So, imagine you have 1,000 models. You will have 1,000 data sets. They are all different, of course. And that is consumed by the data set. So, we can then use the data set to create the data sets. And that is consumed by the engine we have in Spark to create the model automatically. Of course, there is some communication there with our server, but all that can also be piloted by the predictive factory and also scripting or APIs. You want to embed that into an application, you can use the APIs. It's fully transparent. So, you change all the UI, basically, and you get your own interface to what we can do. So, here, on the native Spark modeling part, what happens is the data is transformed there. There is absolutely no data that goes out. It's all processed locally in Spark. And we only get the stats to be able to report on what was done. So, I said our challenge is scaling. How do we scale? If you take all that back, we say, well, we handle all the technical problems of modeling. Modeling is not a problem anymore. Right? I've built the In a day, more than a thousand models. And I could deploy them. I was okay with that. So all the multicollinearity stuff, the missing data, the outliers, there are technical ways. It's, again, the same thing. We can find a theoretical framework in which this is not a problem. And, of course, if you think about some of the things we do, they come from the 30s where computers didn't exist. So maybe we can change that. Okay. We measure the robustness, of course. And the robustness is about giving you the trust in putting the model in production. So if I have 1,000 models, maybe I'll have some that I have. And then I have to reject and rework. But the vast majority, if I have enough positive cases, I can put in production automatically. Of course, we parallelize the processing. So compared to what I can do today on the server, we divide the training time by 10. And this is expanding again. And this was already fast. And today we support. This is only tested 50,000 columns. We aim at 500,000 columns. Okay. That's a big data problem. And variety of the data means lots of columns. So we can produce those data sets automatically when needed. And that's also what is interesting. It's all embedded. A chain, a process where all the parts are together. And then we have the management of the model. So of course, control whenever you want. And that's again automated. That's tasks you define. Automated recalibration on the whole data set. You started with 500,000. You will recalibrate on 500,000 because you don't know what changed. And maybe all that you had in the previous model is completely gone. Okay. So I will pass that. Let's go to this example. So it's for an airplane manufacturer. So there are not so many in the world. I will not tell you where they come from this way. You have to guess. And it's about quality of production. So one of the challenges they have, of course, is if you have a chain of production with sensors, the first thing is to collect all the data and to put it together. Okay. The second phase is, of course, analyzing. That's maybe the simplest one. And the third part is providing ways for human beings to take decisions or to be alerted and do something. And so they have a cluster with roughly one petabyte of data from five lines of production. When you look at the data that is there, you have roughly 500 sensors per line. And one of the difficulties, of course, is that some provide information at the millisecond. And the second part is that some provide information at the millisecond. And some provide information at the hour. So we have to be able to put all that together in a way which is a coherent way. We have data coming from actually usually SAP systems, for example, work orders for maintenance. Everything is recorded. You know exactly what happened on all the machines, which are on the chain of production. You have all the information, again, from the legacy systems about the spare parts, raw material, origin, quality, everything. You have and you have at the end the quality of what is produced. And that's not at the end. That's at every step of the process, manufacturing process. You have compliance. Is my product that I just built or is this thing that I put are those things that I put together compliant with the quality that is set for that specific step? So you can imagine that that is the challenging way. What we are working at the moment is five different models. OK, it's one on composite. It's one on making composites. And that's all about, you know, temperature, composition of the composites and so on. And there are other things. But what they want from these five is extend to roughly 250 models on that chain of production. OK, and the challenges we have, they are the usual challenges we have. Which are really defining the business problem, clearly defining it in a way that we can express it in terms of data sets. And maybe I will take a minute on that, but that's really the role of the data scientist. OK, the data scientist is the guy who who can understand what business says and transform that into the right data in the right format to get the right result. Which is spot on with the business problem that is asked by the business. Because if you don't do that properly, what happens? You will get well, first you lose credibility because you are providing information which is not the right one. OK, so business say, well, is this crap? You know, they are alerting me when things are right. And then you have a big adoption problem. OK, so. And that is what we learn, OK, really, when we are studying how to transform. How to transform these business questions into predictive things and predictive things are first data sets first. The algorithmics, that's whatever. And then there is a scalability problem again, because here the team is five people. OK, five, so they're going to manage at the end 250 models for this line of production and they will be pulled in other projects. So one of the problem is the definition. And I am afraid I couldn't listen to that part, that presentation earlier about feature definition. But this is crucial. And, you know, I have. A sensor measuring the temperature somewhere. I have a pressure sensor. How do I normalize the way I will transform this data to make it available for all the models I need to build, that's things that we need to define or they need to define in their environment to be able to scale as well. Well. I will try to speak Swedish. So thanks so much. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Transcription for Exploring Green Building and the Future of Construction.mp3:  This episode is brought to you by Brilliant. Click the link in the description below. A lot of focus is put on generating cleaner energy for a sustainable future. But that's just one piece of the puzzle. What if we could dramatically reduce our energy consumption just by changing the way we build our office buildings and skyscrapers? Imagine a skyscraper with smart windows and walls made from fungus. Yes, fungus. Let's explore a green building and the future of construction. And can going net zero really make a difference? I'm Matt Ferrell. Welcome to Undecided. INTRO Building office buildings and skyscrapers with thousands of pounds of concrete, steel, and other materials is a major contributor to pollution and energy use. But it's more than that. Our homes and office buildings' lighting, heating and cooling, poor insulation, and integration into the surrounding environment have a lasting impact on energy use and costs. They require larger amounts of power and water to keep comfortable, which just keeps going on indefinitely. Buildings can count for 20% of the total energy consumption of a building in the next 20 years. But if you're a building that's not a building, you're not going to be able to keep up with the energy consumption. So we're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. We're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. We're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. We need some innovations around how we build our houses, offices, and skyscrapers. This is where net zero and green buildings come in. These constructions are designed and built with the goal of creating a positive impact on the environment and climate. They can combine energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce power consumption, benefit the environment, and improve the quality of life for the people that live and work in those buildings. The concept of green building has been scaling from small houses to big offices and buildings. And that's where we're going to talk about how to reduce that problem. So let's get started. So some international certifications have been developed in order to provide clear guidelines on how to do it. The US Green Building Council developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, also known as LEED, to rate green buildings and provide owners with a framework for cost-saving, high-efficiency, and health for design, construction, operations, and maintenance. Another popular certification is the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method from the UK, also known as BREEAM. Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Breem? Who comes up with these acronyms? Well, anyway, zero energy buildings have on-site renewable power sources like solar panels to try to produce as much clean energy as it consumes. You can't always do 100%, but the goal is to get as much as you can. The power generated during the daytime is consumed by the facility itself, and if there's energy surplus, the building delivers that into the grid to try to compensate for grid energy consumption at night. However, to improve efficiency, energy consumption needs need to be reduced. So heating and cooling, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, and lighting, needs to be minimized. To achieve that, it's recommended to integrate things like green roofs, energy efficient windows with triple-plane glass, and good insulation. Net-zero buildings are also considered green if they're constructed with non-toxic, eco-friendly, and sustainable materials. They should also use less water and have good air quality so it becomes more sustainable. Some of the simplest solutions you may have already seen where you work. A good start to making a building more efficient is using high-efficiency LED and smart lighting, or occupancy sensors hooked up to air conditioning or fan systems. All of those can contribute considerably to reduce energy consumption. But taking things to the next level, engineers and architects can perform advanced analysis through 3D building energy simulation tools to achieve higher efficiencies. Some software like Green Building Studio, EnergyPlus, and IES Energy Modeling enable engineers and architects to improve a green building's design in order to increase their sustainability. They can perform a climate analysis and HVAC simulations to optimize what materials to use and how to orient the building. They can also use the technology to create a green building. If you're interested in learning more about green building, you can check out our video on the Green Building Studio website. They can see exactly how the building will fare throughout the year before it's even built. Examples of green and net-zero buildings have been spreading worldwide over the past decade. In London, for example, Siemens has built the Crystal, one of the greenest buildings in the world. This highly sustainable building is also a unique events venue. It establishes the benchmark for sustainable building design, achieving the Platinum LEED and outstanding BREEAM accreditation, the most rigorous standards for sustainable design. The Crystal is 70% illuminated by natural light, and it's a very good example of how green buildings can be used to create a green building. The solar panels produce 20% of the electricity it uses. Rainwater is collected from the roof and stored in an underground tank for use in the building. 100% of the water that's used in the toilets is taken from non-potable sources just like that. Another interesting feature is the 3500 data points that are used by the Siemens Building Management System to monitor the building's efficiency, which can view water and energy consumption live. The building cost about 30 million pounds in 2012, but saves a lot of money with electricity. Peter Daw, the city's development manager at Siemens, said in terms of CO2 savings, we're saving about 71% compared to an equivalent building. In terms of energy costs, we're saving about 500,000 pounds a year. In Seattle, the Bullitt Center is considered the greenest commercial building in the world. Its structure is mostly composed of heavy timber, and the materials were kept to their natural state to avoid toxins in today's finishes. The wood was sourced locally. The triple-glazed curtain wall, airtight seal, along with the orientation, provides heat control and improved daytime lighting, so the lights are basically off most of the year. In addition, a closed-loop geothermal system meets the heating and cooling load in the office, and an air-to-air heat exchanger provides incoming fresh air from the outside. The Bullitt stores rainwater in a 56,000-gallon cistern in the basement, which is treated and used for non-potable and potable uses, which means they can use it for drinking water. According to Justin Stenkamp, a mechanical engineer with the company that designed the building's control and plumbing systems, these measures alone help to save approximately 80% of the water use over a regular office building. All of that is well and good for building new buildings, but what about existing buildings? One embankment place was built in the early 1990s in London for Price Waterhouse Coopers. It's a great example of zero-energy retrofitting, and today is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It utilizes a tri-generation combined cooling, heat, and power system that's fueled by recycled waste vegetable oil. It also has several spaces to harvest daylight, roof gardens and green walls to make the building more ecological, and low-flush toilets to reduce water use. Currently, the one embankment place emits 40% less carbon than a typical building of its size, and 20% of its heat and 60% of its energy needs are produced on-site. Price Waterhouse Coopers has saved 14 million pounds with energy and carbon related costs. Another retrofitting example is Powerhouse Jorbo, located in Berrum, Norway. I hope I didn't butcher that pronunciation, because I most likely did. These two office buildings from the 80s were retrofitted with efficient ventilation, insulation, and daylight. In addition to producing renewable energy on-site, the energy needs of the buildings have been reduced by more than 86%. As a result, Powerhouse Jorbo received an outstanding classification from Brie M. Noor. And probably the coolest part, the building produces about 230,000 kWh of energy, but only consumes about 100,000 kWh. With new buildings and retrofitting old buildings, what's the forecast of net zero-adaptation? According to one report, the global net zero energy building market share was valued at $896 million in 2018 and is expected to reach $2.1 billion by 2024. That's some serious growth that's being spurred on by not only policy, but the value it drives for building owners. Besides reducing utility bills and zeroing out energy use, it can increase the building's valuation and isolate owners from future energy price variation. On top of that, the benefits also reach out to the people who live and work in the green buildings by experiencing fresh air and enjoying an environment more connected to nature. And there's the positive impact on the environment due to water conservation and energy and material efficiency. So if this is all so great, why is it still a bit unusual to see a green or net zero energy office building? I worked on one for years here in Boston, but they're still hard to come by. The cost of building a zero energy building is higher than constructing a common one because the building materials are usually more expensive. And there still isn't a vast number of designers or builders that are hard to come by. But there's a lot of work to be done to build a green office. So it's a good idea to build a green office building that's highly skilled and experienced in this type of building. Also, high rises have many spaces and occupants in a vertical building with limited roof space for solar panels. So it's difficult for all of them to produce the energy that they consume. A study conducted by the United Kingdom Green Building Council analyzed the feasibility of the design, delivery, and cost of new net zero carbon buildings. In the study, they broke it down into two buckets. For office buildings being built using net zero goals now through 2025, the cost is about 6.2% higher than the cost of building a green office building. The cost is about 6.2% higher than the cost of building a green office building. The cost is about 6.2% higher than standard. Looking further out at newer technologies and standards that are expected to be in the norm by 2030, the cost is 8-17% higher than standard. Some governments are rolling out policies to stimulate net zero or nearly net zero energy buildings. The EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a good example. It established that all new construction must be nearly net zero from December 31, 2020, so everything from now on needs to meet that criteria. Energy performance certificates must be issued when construction is rented or sold and promote smart technologies like building automation and control systems. Then there's the World Green Building Council, which is a group of 70 green building councils from around the world, who have among other initiatives the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This challenges organizations, businesses, cities, states, and regions to all make assets under their direct control, operate at zero carbon by 2030. There are currently 94 businesses and organizations, 28 cities and 6 states and regions participating. By sharing knowledge and lessons learned, the initiative aims to remove the barriers to net zero implementation and inspire others to take action. In addition to green policies, another approach to reduce cost and improve efficiency of net zero buildings are newer technologies and techniques currently being researched, like fungus. Yes, fungus.

So, fungus. How about walls made of plant materials? This is still in the experimental stage, but it uses mycelium, a kind of fungal spore that can be used to fill a form with an agricultural product. The final result is a solid brick or plate. This composite has no toxic chemicals and doesn't take a lot of energy to make. The material could be used as insulation between non-biodegradable materials to avoid breaking apart since it is biodegradable. A project using this material was developed by The Living Studio in New York in cooperation with Ecovative Design. The Hi-Fi project was a tower about 12 meters high, composed of 10,000 bricks made of mushroom mycelium and shredded corn stalks. When the event ended after three months, the structure was dismantled and the bricks decomposed to compost. Exploiting the material was a challenge, but it was worth it. The project was a success, and it was a success. While it's not primarily for net zero reasons, using mycelium to build structures is also being studied by NASA to grow habitats on the Moon and Mars. It has higher bend strength than reinforced concrete, is a great insulator, and can regrow and repair itself. If it's good enough for Martians, why not us? A newer technology that deals with solar radiation and its heat is electrochromic glass . It utilizes nanotechnology, which is something that I covered in a recent video, to produce small electrical signals to slightly charge the windows in order to change the quantity of radiation they reflect. This technology could help control the heat inside a building, which could save a lot of money on HVAC costs, mainly in the summer. Usually smart windows start with a bluish color and after a few minutes turn transparent when you apply electrical charges. Some companies have been producing and improving this technology. For example, View Inc., which is an American smart window company, implemented a project for Netflix's office in Los Gatos, California. They used 56,200 square feet of their smart glass, which uses a predictive automated system that can be customized and controlled through an app. It takes a holistic view of the building, like the arc of the sun or obstructions, to dynamically adjust the tint of the windows. As you can see, there are a lot of different options and techniques out there for improving how we build our buildings and use energy to keep them comfortable. Even though the costs are still not universally affordable for all office and skyscraper owners, the development of new materials, technologies, design improvements, and government incentives can help the growth of this market worldwide. It's pretty easy to imagine high-rise buildings and office parks with green roofs and zero energy popping up in more and more cities in the next few decades. Much like Apple Park, which is the largest LEED Platinum Certified building. Jump into the comments and let me know what you think.

      "Transcription for Green Building Explained.mp3:  Hello friends, Green building is a smart way of constructing buildings that helps protect the environment and keeps people healthy. It involves designing, constructing and maintaining structures in a way that doesn't harm nature and keeps us safe. The goal is to reduce the impact on the environment and make sure people stay well. Green building means constructing buildings in a way that is good for the environment and saves energy and resources. It looks at all parts of the building and managing them to be efficient and not harm the environment. The goal is to create structures that use less energy, use materials wisely and are responsible to the environment. Now let us discuss some key principles and concepts associated with green building. Energy efficiency Green buildings use smart designs to save energy. They choose things like energy-saving appliances, lights and heating or cooling systems. They also like to use renewable energy such as sunlight with solar panels or wind power with turbines. This helps make buildings good for the environment. Sustainable materials Choosing the right materials is really important in green building. We want materials that don't harm the environment when we use them and use them in the right way. The goal is to choose materials that can save all the energy on the environment around us and emit Asbestos Flakes. The one thing is crucial that we safer house than часть of the surrendering energy. By spending more energy on the reforestation and energy-saving office, weはいђу know the best way to reduce carbon by reusing renewable materials. We like to use things that grow back journo. We also like using things that grow quickly so we don't run out of Email services during our work so that we can get back to green timetable. This helps make our buildings better for the Earth. Green building miknow Green building makesisaand�� We äld nicht käën ire ir emperor trial page water conservation Jessica Green takaas Gmail Websites for kgùng où etiñate and cacheł water. This can mean using special plumbing that doesn't waste much water, collecting rainwater, and choosing plants in the garden that don't need a lot of water. It is all about being careful with water so we don't use too much and waste it. Site selection and land use. Green building thinks about how construction affects the environment around it. It cares about saving natural areas, planning land use responsibly, and making sure not to disturb ecosystem too much. Waste reduction. During the construction of a building, a significant amount of waste is generated. But green building tries to make less garbage by using things again and again. They do this by recycling materials. Also, they use clever ways of constructing buildings, like making parts of buildings in a factory and putting them together on site. This helps to minimize the mess during the construction of a building. Indoor environmental quality. Green buildings make sure that people inside them stay healthy and comfortable. They do this by making sure the air you breathe inside is clean, having good ways for air to move around. Like windows and fans, and using materials that are not harmful to your health. This way, living or working in these buildings is good for you and doesn't make you sick. Innovation and technology. Green building uses new technologies and creative ways of building to help the environment. This may include the incorporation of smart building systems, advanced insulation methods, and the use of green infrastructure, like green roofs and permeable pavement. All of these ideas make buildings more eco-friendly and better for the planet. Certification systems. Certification systems like LEED–Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design set rules to check if a building is green. They look at things like how much energy a building uses, how well it saves water, and the impact on it has on the environment. These rules make sure a building meets the standards for being considered environmentally friendly. Green building is like constructing building with a smart plan. It is always changing and getting better with new ideas and tools. The main goal is to build things in a way that helps us now without hurting the world for the people who come after us. It is like finding a balance between what we need today and making sure we don't use up everything so there is enough left for the people of tomorrow. So friends see you in the next video. Thanks for watching.\n",

      "Transcription for 10 Eco-Friendly Building Materials ｜ Sustainable Design.mp3:  This video was sponsored by the Nick Morne Foundation. Concrete and steel production releases tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year, contributing to air pollution and climate change. Fortunately, there are some more sustainable materials which can be used for construction. In this video, we're going to be taking a look at some alternative yet eco-friendly materials, such as seaweed, mushrooms and even coffee, and their practical applications in construction. Formally used as wine stoppers or bulletin boards, in recent years, cork has been found to be one of the most sustainable building materials in the world. With eco-minded construction companies in search of more lightweight, low-cost, sustainable and versatile building materials that not only are aesthetically pleasing, but also effectively insulate and provide long-term protection from the elements, cork ticks all of the boxes. Cork is harvested from a watery, repellent layer of bark on the cork oak tree, mostly grown in the Mediterranean region of South West Europe and Northern Africa. One reason that cork is so sustainable is that no trees actually need to be cut down in order for it to be harvested, and it is easy to recycle. The trees grow for 25 years until their trunks are wide enough, and then the cork can be stripped from them every nine years. Cork oak trees can live up to 300 years, and the older a cork tree is, the better quality the cork that is harvested is. Interconnecting blocks and roof tiles made from cork can provide durability and easy assembly, while also allowing the structure to blend in with its surrounding environment. These are just a few examples of how cork has been used in building homes, hotels, studios and exhibitions around the world. Colombia is one of the world's largest coffee producers, exporting an estimated 15 million bags of coffee beans, not just for coffee. Colombia is one of the world's largest coffee producers, exporting an estimated 15 million bags of coffee beans, not just for coffee. and 2019 alone. Despite the booming business, Colombia is also unfortunately one of the world's most economically disadvantaged countries, with around 35% of its population living in poverty. This has led to many people unable to afford housing, an issue that Bogota-based construction company Woodpecker hopes to solve. By combining coffee husks with recycled plastic, Woodpecker has developed building blocks that link together around a steel frame to create lightweight and easy-to-use buildings. to create lightweight and easy-to-use buildings. The coffee husk is the skin of the coffee bean that dries and falls off during the roasting process, and usually ends up in landfills afterwards. It is stronger and drier than other fibers and allows for these homes, which sell for less than $5,000 each, to be pest and moisture resistant. Nearly 3,000 of Woodpecker's buildings have already been sold, and the company is working alongside the Colombian government to build a new building. and the company is working alongside the Colombian government to build a new building. and the company is working alongside the Colombian government to build a new building. to help house those who have been displaced due to natural disasters. to help house those who have been displaced due to natural disasters. For projects inside the home, Dutch designer Mieke Maier and a team of five have developed newspaper board crispy paper wood an original material adaptable for floorboards, hybrid furniture shelving, concept car interiors and more. Made from sheets of recycled newspaper glued together and layered,餟灰 The pieces are then dried, compacted, sawed and sanded, giving it the look of wood grain. Due to the size and strength limitations of newspaper, newspaper wood is not aiming to act as a large-scale alternative to wood, but it does offer a potential solution to the global paper waste problem. In the UK alone, it is estimated that over 6.3 trillion tonnes of paper are thrown away every year, whereas recycling can save millions of trees. Imagine a material with the potential to be the key to a sustainable future in the fields of fashion, art, food, shipping, construction and more. Mycelium, or the tiny thread-like roots of mushrooms, may just be able to fill these big shoes. It is 100% biodegradable and compostable, yet when dried is strong and durable enough to resist mould, water and fire. In recent years, mycelium has been used for creating eco-conscious packaging materials, meat alternatives and even skin care products. So, what is mycelium? Mycelium is a material that is used to make a material that is not toxic, but is also used to make a material that is not toxic. Now, however, mycelium compressed into bricks is one of the construction industry's most exciting and promising new building materials. Because fungi are living, breathing organisms, they self-regenerate quickly and can assemble themselves into lightweight yet solid objects in a very short time. For more precise or complex projects like insulation, mycelium can be used in 3D printing, making it the ultimate non-toxic building material. Examples of mycelium structures include the high-fiber, the high-fiber, the high-fiber in Queens, New York, the Growing Pavilion in the Netherlands created to showcase how mycelium self-assembles, and the MycoTree project in Seoul, South Korea exhibited to show how mycelium is strong enough to act as an essential structure and support for buildings, while also adding natural beauty to any space. You may think of green algae as something that only grows in your local pond or river, but in Hamburg, Germany, green algae is being used to provide energy for an entire building. The photosynthesis occurs from the production of green algae in the soil and other materials that weren't used to make mycelium. in the algae cells turns the sun's energy into fuel for the building. The algae rapidly grows within the glass panels that cover the entire building where it is then extracted and put into a bioconverter which turns the algae into biomass. This biomass can then be used for a number of things including a source of food for humans or animals and it can also power cars but its greatest ability is that it can generate electricity and heat for those living in the building. When we visited this project in 2019 we were told that the process was actually producing so much energy that it could also power the surrounding buildings too. You can learn more about this and other green projects in our green architecture video here. In the UK alone nearly 3 billion disposable diapers are thrown into landfill each year. To tackle this issue Canadian company No Waste are recycling diapers and other absorbent sanitary products into roof tiles. The recycling process sanitizes the waste to create two different materials. Firstly they remove the organic fibers and use them for green energy and paper while secondly they extract the plastic binding these sanitary products to recycle into a variety of other products including plastic cladding, decking and roof tiles. Sending these otherwise disposable products to the No Waste facility will save the same amount of space in the UK's landfills as 96 other disposable products. Another zusammen CEO proposes to use these AsOnL правdrom announce that NO Waves League will be involved in theät karma gas at a gas station in order to save lives. While they are still recycling as a result of their work trying to stop bad heating, gas is clean going off cement belt was where It is one of the most eco-friendly materials of all the examples mentioned in this video, as the materials for construction can be found on the site of construction rather than needing to be imported from elsewhere. It is also, in my opinion, the best looking material, as Cobb allows you to easily create unique home styles, curves and furniture built directly into the walls. Indian engineer Nizambi Maté discovered that Nairobi's plastic waste pollution was becoming a serious problem. Nairobi produces over 500 metric tonnes of plastic waste every single day, but less than 9% of the city's plastic waste was being recycled. Instead of waiting for the government to do something, Maté took action. Machines that Maté designed herself mixed plastic and sand together at high temperatures, where the plastic when melted acts as a binder. The mixture is then mixed with the plastic and sand together. The mixture is then mixed with the plastic and sand together at high temperatures, where the plastic when melted acts as a binder. The mixture is then mixed with the plastic and sand together at high temperatures, where the plastic when melted acts as a binder. The mixture is then compressed into bricks that are stronger than concrete and lighter too, which helps cut costs and shipping, and makes their use in buildings less labour intensive. Looking towards the future, there is no limit to what Maté hopes to achieve. Seeking investors across Africa to scale her business for the whole continent, Maté hopes to pave the way for upcycling efforts around the world. Plant based polyurethane rigid foam is manufactured from materials like kelp, hemp, and tin. It is highly resistant to moisture and heat and offers protection against mould and pests. In addition to being considered more eco-friendly, some types of plant based foam have actually been shown to improve insulation, thermal resistance, and be better protection against issues that often plague homes using typical insulation materials. On the island of Laisu, located off the coast of Denmark, homes made with roofs of seaweed, etc. are being made with more than 300 years old. Apart from their humongous size, they look a lot like thatch, but seaweed is far more durable and it reproduces itself every year in the sea and comes ashore without any effort from humans. It is then dried on nearby fields by sun and wind, and easily carried to building sites due to its light weight. A more modern example of seaweed use in construction are these seaweed pillows which were used as cladding for a home designed by the Copenhagen municipality. Some of the most popular and popular materials used in construction are the windbreaker, the Hagen architecture firm Van Kusten. Their aim was to design a new house that combines traditional materials with 21st century construction techniques.

      "Transcription for Varun Bhartiya's live session at DCW 2024 on how AI is shaping the Future of Construction.mp3:  In order to adopt AI, I think there's also a change of mindset required. Every company is using AI for certain bits and pieces. It is maturing slowly. So we have to, for significant period of time, work in collaboration with AI. This episode is recorded live at Digital Construction Week at the Excel in London, where I interviewed some of the best and brightest in the built environment for a revealing look at innovation and technology. Varun Bhatia is the co-founder and CEO of EncircleTech, a company at the forefront of empowering passionate innovators in the architecture, engineering, construction and manufacturing industry, providing disruptive solutions that reduce time to market and exceed business goals. From Varun's early days blending coding and 3D visualizations, along with the integration of AI, machine learning and other groundbreaking technologies, EncircleTech has collaborated with over 75 software companies and successfully developed over 200 client projects. Varun has been recognized as an inventor, technologist, entrepreneur and visionary leader in the industry. Varun has been a leading entrepreneur in the field of 3D design and visualization automation for more than 15 years, and he's now seen as a thought leader and innovator deeply involved with AI, who is driven by his passion for helping companies unlock the transformative potential of AI in the construction industry and how AI can accelerate construction processes to make them better, smarter and faster. I can think of no better person to discuss this with than Varun. Varun, welcome to the podcast. Thank you. So I'm going to start by looking at your company and getting your view on where EncircleTech is today. You've been going for 12 years and have expanded your global footprint in Japan, UK, and the world. And I'm sure you've had a lot of fun with the technology you're using. What are some of the things that you've learned from the technology you're using? I think the first thing is that you're going to be able to do a lot of things. You're going to be able to do a lot of things in the UK, Korea, Canada and the likes. And you have over 250 employees. That's impressive. And you serve more than 100 clients. Wow. In your own words, what does EncircleTech look like right now? So EncircleTech is at an intersection of BIM knowledge, AEC knowledge, software development expertise and AI ML. We bring these three skill sets together to build a team. We have a team of engineers who are going to help innovators in the construction space build great solutions and supercharge the construction, which is the need of the hour. Every industry, every, I mean, as you can see in DCW right here, there are so many companies innovating. Yeah. And they need more and more workforce who can kind of build these solutions with the right expertise. Over the last 12 years, we've been building solutions for over 100 companies. We've enjoyed the expertise that we bring in. In terms of how a product should be designed, which technologies are supposed to be used. We often find a lot of customers making the wrong choice of technology. Okay. And then trying to fix that long term with our expertise. So that's the expertise that we bring in as an automation for all these companies. Okay. It's interesting that you said getting the right technology. Because I think that's the key. Yeah. And that's absolutely critical. And where some organizations struggle is they just want a solution. And it's no, no, no, you don't want a solution. You want the right solution. Right solution. Absolutely. Excellent. So let's talk a little bit broader. And like you rightly said, as you can see all around us at Digital Construction Week, the UK construction industry isn't short of digital tools and innovation, large and small. Can you share some insights and best practices organizations need to adopt to keep people engaged? Can you share some of the things that they need to adopt to keep pace with the rapid change of technology that's currently occurring? What should they be looking to do? I think in today's world, as we all know and probably have realized, it is very important to make all the decisions based on data. But if you look at it from what is actually happening in the industry, data has to be extracted from BIM models, from the data that's being used in the industry. Extracted from BIM models, from ERP systems, from 100 other sources. And by the time that data is presented to any decision maker, it's practically two to four week old data because a lot of that is manual. Now, imagine you don't even want to read a newspaper that is one day old. Absolutely. And here we are talking about making large organization decisions based on two week old data. Wow. How bad is that? Yeah, for sure. We are creating solutions that is fast tracking this process, making data accessible in dashboards in right form and in a near real time manner. Because with specifically data, you don't even want copies of data. These days what happens, unfortunately, the construction industry has so many tools. You have your files in one system. You use another system for one particular operation and third system for something else. Or even a spreadsheet. And still spreadsheets have not been discarded yet. They continue to exist for whatever long you have. Yeah, absolutely. But the problem with all this is there is duplication and the data goes out of sync. You can't keep all the data in sync with each other. So you're making decisions which is old data. You're making decisions on the data which means new data. You're making decisions on the data which may not be in the sync with all other systems. We need to fix this problem. And that's the solution. We are building connectors, bringing data from all your systems into various dashboards, Power BI or whatever people want to look at. I love that answer. When you were talking about a newspaper, I was thinking of a shopping list and using one that was four weeks old to go and get you shopping. I mean, how crazy is that? How crazy. Like you said. It's like a million pound organization. It's not a quick trip to Tesco. Exactly. I mean, and you still, I mean, leadership are, I mean, I have been in a leadership position. See, when I talk to my organization based on an old data, even if I'm making someone accountable, they always have an excuse. Oh, you know, that was the case two weeks back, but now it has changed. And then when you're dragging what is the status today? I think it's the same thing. You can't just drag your data again to make up for the information. You just can't catch up with the system. So it is very, very crucial that your data has to be very accurate and near real time to make and people are doing it. And if you are not doing it in your organization, you're likely to be left behind. Okay. That's excellent. Excellent advice. So. Ben, CircleTech has collaborated with over 75 software companies and successfully developed over 200 client projects to date. That's impressive. Could you share some successful case studies or examples where your tailored solutions have improved project outcomes while streamlining workflows successfully? Sure. So we work with one of the largest shared office space provider, co-working space provider. You can imagine. They had 500 plus office buildings spread across the globe, trying to make sense of all this data at one place. Again, similar. I mean, in this space, it is very difficult to compare one building to another. Some of them may have more hot desk. Some of them may have lesser hot desk. Some of them may have larger pantry and common area and some of them less. But you need to identify how to compare all these. Okay. So you need to identify how to compare all these properties and what changes you need to make in each of these properties to maximize your return. They had no clue of how to visualize all this data together. We were able to pull all their data from ACC, BIM 360 data directly from the BIM model because we also found that in some cases, again, the problem was duplication of data. Okay. So we had duplication of data when you put it in spreadsheet. You accidentally type 40 instead of 4 in a conference room, which is 10 by 10. You can never fit that many people, that many chairs in a conference room that small, but it happens. Yeah. So you need data directly from the BIM models representing you the actual use case. And it has to be real time. We were able to present those that go to the CEO of the organization, which helped them fix data. Which helped them fix leakage in their systems and thus become profitable, even get to an IPO with profitable growing story. So that's the outcome and that's the benefit of data that we bring in. That's amazing. That's a great example. Absolutely fantastic. Just moving on a little bit, I'm going to take a quote directly from your website here stating that McKinsey reported that AI possesses the potential to deliver an additional additional level of data. So it's a great example of how AI can deliver an additional estimated economic activity of $13 trillion by the year 2030. Coining the phrase, the fourth industrial revolution. But it doesn't look like being that easy to deploy and it shouldn't really. It's new technology. So where are the concerns around AI implementation and are we actually ready for this? Very interesting question. I know AI and ML has been the buzzword. And it's a big one. Yeah. Everyone is talking about it. And there's no everyone. Probably if you visit every exhibit here, everyone has some component of AI in their offering. Yeah. But it is also important to understand in order to adopt AI, I think there's also a change of mindset required. Yes. Every company is using AI for certain bits and pieces. And AI is maturing slowly. So we have to for significant period of time, we have to work in collaboration with AI. Okay. Even today, when all this chat GPT, LAMA models, everything has been coming up, you have to imagine that they are not making it public for like reliable information. Okay. As soon as it comes, they do have a disclaimer that they are not making it public for reliable information. And I think they will come up with a disclaimer that they are not making it public for value. Yeah. Because they do have a disclaimer that this is AI generated and you have to interpret your own options. So when companies are adopting in construction, they are adopting AI and ML. My advice or my recommendation here is first ask the question, are you okay with 90 to 95% accuracy? Is your team ready to work in collaboration with AI and ML? Because I often find companies doing a switch, but then they don't want to do that. I would say, for example, like, I think in a company like B2B, it is very difficult to just say, I'm going to do this. So it's not something that I would do. I'm going to do that. So it's not something that I would do. I'm going to do that. But I think it's not something that I would do. First, ask the question, are you okay with 90 to 95% accuracy? Is your team ready to work in collaboration with AI and effort? Because I often find companies doing a switch, but then as soon as we bring in the AI component, the team says, oh, then AI is supposed to do 100%. Yeah, of course. Otherwise, I won't adopt it. So it's like they're really comparing it as a replacement of and it is being treated like that. Yeah, that stage will come or so but it takes time. The true potential of AI is collaboration with humans. I mean, humans have to understand they are assisting us. I mean, AI is assisting me in doing my work more efficiently. So pick problem statements where you can reduce the number of options. Let's say you have 1000 issues. 1000 options. Can you reduce it down to five most important ones? That's where the value of AI can really be important and value adding. Any use cases which are which require 100% accuracy are going to be a long gamble, because it takes a whole lot of time to build the solutions. And then meeting that 100 or near 100% accuracy takes a lot of time. So I think that's where the value of AI is going to be. Yeah, sure. I get that. And that's, it's so crucial to remember that we're still still part of this. We're still involved in this, you know. Let's look a little bit more internally than at nCircleTech. So machine learning and AI can certainly make admin tasks more efficient within any sector, specifically construction. A 2017 McKinsey report stated that construction firms could boost productivity by as much as 50% through real time. And that's a lot of data. So we're still looking at that. And we're still looking at the real time analysis of data, which nCircleTech does fantastically. Although it was published seven years ago, I'm pretty sure the percentages will have increased in 50%. It's probably 60, 70, 80. But if we look internally, how are you and nCircleTech using machine learning and AI? We in nCircle, we build solutions that fast track our end to end offering with a lot of companies. We operate by understanding their process, replicating that first manually, and then optimizing it on day to day basis with automations. So let's take an example of scan to BIM. We are building our own solution, which is machine learning based, trying to first identify components from the point cloud data, because that also adds a lot of value to a lot of companies. Segment the point cloud data and then create BIM models all automatically from the BIM data. I mean, from the point cloud data. There are many use cases, not just internally, but we have worked on many use cases with our customers. One of our customers is into buying old properties where undervalue and old constructed hundred year old house exists, which is underperforming, not energy efficient, replacing that with the state of the art house with all the modern and new. So that's where we're going to be. Our target company is likeнизIt We're looking for mistakes, for clothing that utilize A lot of reproduce of prusalem標 Stress aren't clear from this specific approach, but we're active on the market in this organization. S nuclear and nuclear power plants need control lip. Unlike most other governments, nuclear power plants do not need control lip. Policy. give you maximum roi they are currently most undervalued as compared to the vicinity but delivering maximum value once it is upgraded with latest house so definitely different use cases from our scan to bim solutions to this property identification to even competitive analysis i mean companies are investing in competitive analysis because you can't go after every rfp that is thrown at you you want to prioritize if ai can help you screen 100 rfps and probably bring it down to five that you need to really invest into yeah and then that's where the human element comes in and you make that decision that's when you win but if you use ai to say can i go after this rfp yes or no not that it becomes a gamble it becomes a gamble and you don't want that to happen yeah absolutely fantastic so looking towards the future then as technology continues to evolve how do you foresee the future of card and bim software developing in construction um i think data is becoming more and more gold mine for everyone gone are the days when most of these bim and cad companies were protecting their data and they were using the proprietary formats i think we all see a shift that all these companies are now open to exchange of data because every other company is using mix of tools to work with their data yeah we've seen a lot of government organizations not wanting to pay for access to their data because and companies have made money charging all these organizations just for the access of data so i think uh it is time the big change that is going to happen is more exchange of data a very high degree of interoperability people have realized that this is going to be a bold mine and is a bold money uh some companies are working on organizing this data internally better because they have executed hundreds of projects in the past and their data is not in the consumable format yeah and very next after this is the ai is going to be the key to that world mind because humanly it becomes humanly impossible to yeah all this data and ai can help you really unlock its full potential yeah so i think my feedback or my bet is on how ai and data is going to transform this industry quite yeah yeah i mean we're not short of data are we we're not short of data we love it right we're just getting back into consumer Transformation to to to deliver the right outcomes and um yeah I I a huge fan of of what you're doing at the moment I think it's it's it's really uh interesting our customers enjoy the right consultancy that we bring in the right uh guidance because every time you don't have so much bandwidth to invest or stewardship of data or customer models, what are you trying to do then? yeah we have GOD liberal agency and they are very marshall has a security and security role and or bring people in house, research on all these topics. We bring this expertise from global development and this fast track go to market for our customers. Fantastic. So final question from me, we're here at Digital Construction Week. Just give us your thoughts about the event. I think this year the event has been very enthusiastic, very energetic. I think very huge participation as compared to past events that I have attended. Very happy with the footfall and the conversations that are happening. Just as an advice, if I can give you, I think all of us are getting bombarded with lot of solutions out there. And there is a sense of being overcautious about adopting anything. People are always evaluating and they are always evaluating. They are always evaluating things with a sense of suspicion that will this work or will this not work or whatever. But I think I would encourage to go with open mindset. There are many hidden gems out here. If you go with an open mindset, have some bandwidth to experiment, I think they're going to add a lot of value. Yeah. Construction industry is always in this catch up game. When they have money, they don't have time to innovate. When they have time, they don't have money to innovate. For sure. So we need to find some time and money to experiment and always keep innovating. Absolutely. Excellent advice. Excellent advice. Varun, thank you so much for coming out. It's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you. Thank you for having me. And it was a pleasure talking to you.\n",

      "Transcription for The material that could change the world... for a third time.mp3:  The Roman Civilisation Thousands of years ago, the Romans invented a material that allowed them to build much of their sprawling civilization. Plenty the elder praised an imposing sea wall made from the stuff as impregnable to the waves and every day stronger. He was right. Much of this construction still stands, having survived millennia of battering by environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today our roads, sidewalks, bridges and skyscrapers are made of a similar, though less durable, material called concrete. There's three tons of it for every person on Earth and over the next 40 years we'll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City every single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way it's changed our world. It's also played a surprisingly large role in rising global temperatures over the last century. A trend that has already changed the world and threatens to even more drastically in the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically everything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come from industrial processes we often aren't aware of, but touch every aspect of our lives. Around your home, refrigeration along with other heating and cooling makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food, accounts for 18%. Electricity is responsible for 27%. Walk outside in the cars, zipping past, planes, overhead trains, ferrying, commuters to work, transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% of greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things, making them produces emissions. A lot of emissions. Making materials, concrete, steel, plastic, glass, aluminum and everything else, accounts for 31% of greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% of all carbon emissions worldwide, and it's much more difficult to reduce the emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement. One of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients, gravel, sand and water, together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make cement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement is calcium oxide, CAO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate, CaCO3. We extract CAO from CaCO3 by heating limestone. What's left is CO2, carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce, we release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help us change the world a third time. By eliminating greenhouse gas emissions and stabilizing our climate. Right now, there's no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas to help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels to heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean electricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from the limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture. Specifically, capturing the carbon right where it's produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren't widely used because there's no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing the captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store captured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with the fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways to reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working to uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny's remark is literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash in their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater, the seawater strengthened it, making their concrete stronger and more long-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal of modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success. Both by making long-lasting structures and ensuring our descendants can admire them, thousands of years from now. The world's biggest battery looks nothing like a battery. Watch this video for a delightful surprise, or learn a quick and easy way to explain climate change with this myth.\n",
      "Transcribing Self healing concrete and asphalt： Erik Schlangen at TEDxDelft.mp3 with Whisper...\n",
      "Transcription for Self healing concrete and asphalt： Erik Schlangen at TEDxDelft.mp3:  Ny Perfect, The You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. It's made of asphalt. And asphalt is a very nice material to drive on. But not always. Especially not on these days as today, when it's raining a lot, then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt. And especially if you're then wide with your bicycle and pass these cars, then that's not very nice. Also asphalt can create a lot of noise. It's a noisy material. And if we produce roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent road. So we have solutions for that. The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt, material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can just drain through it, like you see in this image. So all the rainwater will flow away to the side and you have a road easy to drive on, so no splash water anymore. Also the noise will disappear in these pores, because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road. It also has disadvantages, of course. And disadvantage of this road is that ravelling can occur. What is ravelling? You see that in this road, that the stones at the surface come off. So it actually happens, first you get one stone, then several more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and then they... I will not do that. But they can damage your windshield, so you're not happy with that. And finally this ravelling can also lead to more and more damage. Like you see in the next image, sometimes you can create potholes with that. He's ready. Potholes, of course, that can become a problem. But we have a solution. Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. It supports asphalt, like I said, so I have only a small amount of binder between the stones and this binder, due to ravelling, due to UV light, due to oxidation, this binder, this bitumen, the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink. And if it shrinks, it gets microcracks and it delaminates from the aggregates. And then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates, what we just saw here. To solve this problem, we sort of self-healing materials. If we can make this material self-healing, then probably we have a solution. So what we can do is use a steel wool, just to clean pans, like you see in the big picture. And the steel wool, we can cut in very small pieces. And these very small pieces, we can mix through the bitumen. So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you can use for cooking, induction machine. Induction can heat, especially steel, it's very good in that. And then what you do is you melt, you heat up the steel, you melt the bitumen, and the bitumen will flow into these microcracks and the stones are again fixed to the surface. Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here on the stage. So a microwave is a similar system. So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. I need my gloves again. So this is the specimen coming out now. So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens. We tested a lot of specimens there, and then the government, they actually saw our results and they thought, well, that's very interesting. We have to try that. So they donated to us a piece of highway, 400 meters of the A58, goes to Vlissinger, where we had to make a test track to test this material. So that's what we did here. You see where we are making the test road. And then of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice. So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. So we did aging on the samples, did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine, and healed them and tested them again. Again broke them, healed them. Several times we can repeat that. So actually the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine, this is the big version we have made to go on the real road, if we go on the road every four years, we can double the service life of this road, which of course saves a lot of money. So took a glute, I can say that we made a material using steel fibers, addition of steel fibers, using induction energy to really increase the service life of the road, double the service life you can even do, so it really saved a lot of money with very simple tricks. And now you are of course curious if it also worked. So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. Actually it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works. But I will do it while. Let's see, yeah, it worked. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribing Concrete, repair thyself ｜ Didier Snoeck ｜ TEDxUHasselt.mp3 with Whisper...\n",
      "Transcription for Concrete, repair thyself ｜ Didier Snoeck ｜ TEDxUHasselt.mp3:  This is a material just like concrete. And for some of you, perhaps most of you, this is a grey and dull material. Now, you're not alone. Think about Elon Musk. Instead of sending an extremely boring grey concrete payload to outer space, he would rather send something more unusual, more fun. So he decided to mount a fancy red Tesla on his Falcon Heavy for a journey to outer space and Mars. And he was partly right. It's grey, that's for sure. But being a researcher and civil engineer at Gantt University, I can tell you it's not boring at all. It's a very versatile material, a very interesting material with even some magical properties. And it's extremely strong. That's why it's the most used construction material in the world. It's a spine in skyscrapers, the spand in bridges, the bulk in dams, roads and tunnel works. And this little piece here can easily bear the weight of a fancy red Tesla. But when we're strolling in a big city, we often look at concrete structures and then we notice that it's all cracked. And that gives us a really unsafe feeling. And it's also very dangerous. Potential hospital substances may start to penetrate the crack and they will start to destroy the concrete from inside. So if we have cracks, the cracks will become larger. Big pieces may also fall down. And that was the case in the tunnels in Brussels a couple of months ago. And it really damaged a lot of cars. And we all know that all those tunnels needed to be closed for repair works and for safety precautions. So it was not that interesting at all. And if you wait too long, the cost would even rise sky high. So the cost for our economy is way too high. And also when you want to build a structure in your house and you're using concrete, the last thing you want to see is concrete cracking. Now wouldn't it be interesting that concrete could heal itself? Quickly, efficiently, and also to regain its complete mechanical properties? And wouldn't it be interesting that concrete would do that without us intervening, without us doing anything? Think about us humans. Isn't it great that our body is able to heal a broken bone quickly, efficiently, and also to completely regain its properties? I remember once when I was a child, I accidentally cut my hand. And I was amazed and baffled by the fact, well, actually I was the only one who was amazed and baffled. My parents were not that happy after all. But I was amazed and baffled by the fact that our body was able to heal itself so quickly. Now what about concrete? Can it heal itself? Yes, it can. But most answers I get are like, you're kidding us. This is science fiction. But it's not science fiction. It's already reality. Concrete is already able to heal itself. Now I want to explain to you how we can efficiently use this because every concrete produced on the globe is able to heal itself. It is not properly used. So I'm going to tell you how. But for that, let me first explain you something about concrete. If you have aggregates, sand, cement, and water, and you mix them together in certain quantities, you will get concrete. Now it's the cement and water which glues everything together and gives the material its strength. But consider this. Not all cement will have come into contact with water, and it will still be waiting in the concrete for water to reenter the structure and to further react. And also the products which are formed in concrete, they can react to something else, also closing down cracks. So we can have healing in concrete. So what I did was I added even more cement. I added some other materials and I reduced the amount of water. So I really had a lot of building blocks present in my concrete. So the job wasn't that hard after all, was it? Well, that's not entirely the case. Consider this. If we would cut ourselves and we cut ourselves deeply, our body would also not be able to heal itself completely. So if we have a crack in concrete which is quite wide, and if we have healing, the crack may close. But not completely. So what's the point of using self-healing concrete? But if we have a narrow crack and if we have healing, the crack can completely be closed. So instead of one big crack, we want to have multiple small cracks in concrete. And that's reached by mixing in these little fellows over here. These are synthetic microfibers. They are as thin as your own human hair. They are a couple of millimeters in length. And they are evenly and randomly distributed in the concrete because we place them there from the beginning. Now when concrete cracks, what happens? If you would put your fingers like this and you would start pulling, you would also feel some friction. So this will be the concrete crack and the fibers will bridge the crack. They will become active. And all the forces will be distributed over that crack and the crack will be stopped. So the concrete will think that it's not cracked after all. So it wants to crack somewhere else. But again, fibers will be active over there and it will also stop the crack. And the concrete will crack somewhere else. Where again, fibers will become active. So instead of one big crack, we will have small multiple cracks. And that's already one step in the right direction. Now on the other hand, when we would cut ourselves, we would start to bleed. And blood for us humans is like water for concrete. So we need to get water into concrete. And that's reached by mixing in these. This will powder. Now by the way, I don't need to mention how fun it is to get this amateurously packed bag of white powder to customs at the airport. But I never had any problems. But the passengers on the left and on the left and to the right of me, they always take a step backwards or sideways when I suddenly put a very big bag of amateurously packed bag of white powder on the conveyor belt. And then they're always pointing like, look at that guy. He's smuggling drugs. I never had any kind of problem. But this is a very interesting material. And I want to perform a small test for you to show you its potential. So I have an empty cup over here. And I'm going to put the white powder into the cup. Just like this. And I also have a cup filled completely with water. Now I already told you it's a very interesting material. I'm just going to perform the test to see what's going to happen. So I'm going to pour the water into the cup on the left. And now what's happening, those powders, they start to absorb water. And quite interestingly, they will also retain the water. So this is very, very interesting material because in this way we can get water into concrete. And it retains the water for sure for quite a long period of time. Now what happens in concrete when we mix everything together? We have our aggregates, sand, cement, water, the fibers, and those polymers over there they will also start to absorb. Now these polymers, they are called superabsorbent polymers. It's quite a long and fancy word for material which can absorb water up to a thousand times its own weight and to retain it like a sponge. They are already found in diapers for babies. So again, really say I started this research from the bottoms up. But this material is very interesting because it can swell, it can retain water and that's used in concrete as well. So like I already told you, it's in concrete, it's already swollen because it takes up part of the mixing water, but then it shrinks back again and it's dry and it's waiting until we have a crack. And if we have a crack, then we can also visualize a superabsorbent polymer. So if we have water inside a crack, superabsorbent polymers also want to seal a crack. And if we perform an other test, if we just put water on cracked specimens, then we can clearly see in a cracked reference sample that the water is running through it. But in the right hand side you can see a specimen with superabsorbent polymers. And quite interestingly, no water is penetrating the structure anymore because the polymers are physically blocking the crack from intruding fluids. And in that way we already have a self-sealing concrete. So not self-healing, but self-sealing because we have a regain in water tightness. Now this water can also be used to trigger healing because like I already told you, we have sufficient building blocks, we have narrow cracks, we also now have water. So at some distinct locations where we have sufficient building blocks, there will be a reaction either by the cement or by the already formed products. And those will start to stitch up a crack. And this process will continue until we get the complete healing of a crack. Now what is also very interesting, those polymers, they can absorb moisture as well. So even in this room, if we would just put it here, they would also start to absorb moisture. So even in this room or in your own house, you would already have partial healing as well. But of course one can argue whether or not it's nice to have this kind of healing because it doesn't mean that if the crack is completely closed, that you also would have a regain in mechanical properties. Now I can tell you we have. In our laboratory we are having specimens which can regain up to 100 percent its initial strength. So that's not that bad after all is it. Because even though it's cracked, it can heal itself and it can regain the properties as if nothing ever happened. So we have a complete healing of the structure. And this is very interesting. Now by using this material we can also reduce repair costs. We can also reduce maintenance costs because we do not need to repair it. And in that way we can expand our opportunities in the building sector. So it's a very promising future for this material. So Elon Musk, in case you're watching, look beyond the Korean concrete. It's not as boring as you think it would be. So look beyond the gray in concrete. Let it emerge by its first style in intriguing properties. It's even magical with self-healing properties. And in that way we keep reinventing concrete all the time. And that ladies and gentlemen is a moonshot idea worth spreading. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Transcribing Smart cities： How technology will change our buildings ｜ Coen van Oostrom ｜ TEDxBerlin.mp3 with Whisper...\n",
      "Transcription for Smart cities： How technology will change our buildings ｜ Coen van Oostrom ｜ TEDxBerlin.mp3:  Good afternoon. This year is 20 years ago that I started in real estate and when I started in real estate this man behind me, he was sort of the guy in real estate and he wrote a book, The Art of the Deal. And that book was about deal making and about making money and making buildings and to be really honest I wanted to do that as well. To be more honest if I would have known that the guy was going in politics I might have skipped it but that I didn't do. And I started my company, I started in Amsterdam and we built it and we became quite successful. We were I guess over the years after one of the larger developers in Western Europe. But then 10 years later, now 9 years ago, I met this guy. El Gore came to the Netherlands and El Gore had just written his book and made his movie and he was talking about global warming. To be honest I wasn't that much of a tree hugger. I wasn't so much of a green knight going around making green buildings. But he was invited to speak at a breakfast meeting organized by a Dutch CEO and I was there as well and I was listening to him and he had a beautiful metaphor. He was talking about the dykes breaking in the Netherlands which for Dutch people is a big thing. And the dykes breaking he said if that would happen that's not a political thing. You know then people will stand shoulder to shoulder and fix it. So why is this not happening when it comes to sustainability? And there was a moment I asked questions and I raised my arm and I said so why are you talking to entrepreneurs? Should you not be talking to governments or to NGOs and you know they should talk about it. He said no. He said the businesses will be the drivers for change. Because if the businesses do not make new products like cars or like planes or like buildings then nothing is going to change. And he looked at me and he said what is it that you do? I said well I've got a real estate company. What can I do? And he said did you know that 35% of carbon emissions in the world come from buildings? I said no I didn't know that. He said but even more important did you know that from every dollar we spent on solving this carbon emission problem a dollar is best spent in the built environment. And I said what do you mean? He said well very simple if you build a windmill, if you build solar panels you always need a subsidy. One day that will change but for now that's a real big thing. But in the building environment if you spend a euro there's a big chance you will make it back in five or ten years. So it actually makes sense to invest in that sector and you have a lot of work to do. So I got really inspired. I got back to my office and I got all my people together. Now I have to tell you a little bit about my company. My company was maybe more on the trump side of things than on the gore side of things to be really honest. But we got some people together and I said we're going to make green buildings. And they were not really convinced but one person raised his hand and said hey I never dare telling you but you know I studied physics but I actually am an expert in climate modelling and I used to work for Greenpeace but nobody is really interested in that story in this company so I didn't tell you that. I'm like okay great you joined the team. So we started to work and it turned out to be not that difficult to make a sustainable building. You just from the beginning have to look at that issue that you want to solve. And we started to do that. Now I could also see that some people in my company were not that convinced. They you know I was the boss so they would do it but they're not really convinced. And I thought I have to send a message. Now for a real estate guy the most important thing for him in his life is his car. You know people were driving BMWs and they were very happy and you know it's an ego thing I guess. And what I did is I said okay we have to change this and I bought a Toyota Prius and I came to the office in my Toyota Prius and I said guys we're going to sell all these old cars and everybody's going to drive this amazing car and we can actually see how much energy we use and that's going to be like a metaphor for what we want to do with buildings. And they were not that happy. And one of these people they took he took the car and he went driving with it and he came back and he said sorry Kuhn I really I just don't like it. And I became really upset and I said this is important we have to change the world and what will our customers think if we come in an old fashioned car. And he said yeah maybe you're right but I've got a better solution and the better solution is let's buy minis because the carbon emissions of a mini is 104 gram CO2 per kilometer which is exactly the same amount as a Toyota Prius has. Why not go the cool way instead of you know you know also in a efficient way but not so cool. And so the funny thing was all these people in the Netherlands were all very tall and they were in these small little minis and whatever that became sort of a funny thing. So we started to do that and the nice thing was that even students would sort of send those letters and say oh we want to work for that company but it also became a metaphor for our buildings because we figured out that if we want to make buildings attractive with low emissions we have to make them nice as well. And sort of the first building we made is this building Las Palmas and we actually owned the warehouse and we redeveloped retrofitted the warehouse and on top we made this sort of UFO shaped building. It became our own office and all the technologies that were available around us and that we knew from let's say universities and from companies we worked with we put in this building. So solar and wind and all kinds of other technologies. And it became one of the more let's say one of the most sustainable buildings in the Netherlands and today I wouldn't say it's the world record but it was pretty good. I found it so good that I said guys this building needs to be blessed and you know who else than the Pope can do that so let's ask the Pope to open the building. And it's a pity but we actually asked the bishop in Rotterdam and the bishop said the Pope doesn't do buildings. And then somebody said well let's ask Gore. We talked to him as well and we decided to ask Bill Clinton, President Clinton and he actually came over he opened the building and he became a big ambassador of green buildings and about this building. So the next step for us was that we wanted to do something really special. We figured out there's so much more than we can do than what we have done so far. Let's go out there. And we were lucky to have a tenant, Deloitte, that said we want to have a building in Amsterdam and we want it to be the most sustainable building in the Netherlands. Now the people in my company still were a little bit on the Trump side of things so they said of the Netherlands, the Netherlands is not relevant, let's do the most sustainable building in the world. And I said yeah let's try that but then the question is of course how do you measure sustainability? And it turns out in the world there's a couple of models of measuring sustainability. There's a system in the US called LEED, there's a German system, a French system but probably the most used system in the world is called BRIEM and it's a system from the UK. And we adopted that system and we knew there was a building in London that had a score of 96%. Theoretically you can go to 100% but the maximum so far was 96%. And we started to work. And you must imagine that if you want to do that then the thing that is happening is that you have to take all the decisions you take in the development process and everything you have to try to be as sustainable as possible and put it in the model. So if you order glass, if you order concrete or even if you order the car for the guy who is managing the building site then that car has to be electrical because even that carbon emission is going to go into the model and if you want to break the world record it's not going to work. And this is what the building looks like. Let me push it again. This is what the building looks like. And it became a beautiful building but it was one little thing. We didn't make the 96%. We got to 95%. And the one thing missing in this model, the last couple of percentage, is that you have to have so-called innovation credits. So you need to do something that has never been done before in the building industry to get those last points in that in that real model. And we went to talk to Siemens and General Electric and startups in Berlin and all kinds of other companies to see if somebody had something that we hadn't, that wasn't used before. And we ended up talking to a Dutch company called Philips and they make LAD systems. And they had a LAD system and you might say, well, LAD isn't that something that everybody uses? That's true. But they had a system where the LAD is not, doesn't get its power from a normal 230 volt cable but from an ethernet cable and it called light over ethernet. And the great thing is that not only is the cable a lot more efficient, so you save energy, which was important for our model, but the great thing is that an ethernet cable is a two-way street. So you can get data from that little light and transport it back to a central computer. Now, that part I didn't really get at that time. I was just happy that we got the credits. And the building became 98% and officially the edge in Amsterdam is now the world's most sustainable building, which is nice. So at the day of the opening, these people that made it, they gave me a book about big data. And I heard about big data but I wasn't really sure what it was all about. But the sensor that you see here, and we have 32,000 of those sensors in that building, they measure all kinds of information. Suddenly, we can connect to your smartphone and we know exactly who is where in the building. Now, you might say, I don't really want people to know where I am in the building, but for a building manager, in the old days, everybody would have their own desk. And we all know that roughly 30% to 40% of desks in a building are not being used. I'm not talking about the weekends, I'm not talking about the night, but within working hours, they're not being used for so many hours. And so if the building manager knows exactly who you are and where you are, you can actually tell the computer in the morning, you say, hey, I'm going to be working from home till 11. From 11 to 2, I have meetings. Well, I need a meeting room. And then in the late afternoon, what I want to do is read a contract. So I need a quiet place. And the building can then adapt to what you're doing. Now, if a lot of people start doing that, then the total amount of space that you save by doing that is 30%. Compare that to what Airbnb is doing. Airbnb is basically doing the same thing. They use the inefficiencies that are around real estate and that we all know and that it's difficult to solve. But information will solve that. But then we found out that if you go in this whole world of the internet of things, that there are so many more things that you can do. We have a cleaning company working for us. And the cleaning company, the people working there, they have a little iPad. And on their iPad, they can see exactly how often a toilet has been used. They have a heat map where you can see if a floor has been used or not, and whether that has to be cleaned. Now, in the old days, cleaning of a toilet would happen, you know, typically at the end of the day. But we all know that it's actually fun that if toilet has been used for, let's say, 30 times a day, that it gets cleaned. Now, that is now possible based upon the information that comes out of the building. A whole different topic is the whole health in a building. It's sort of weird that we are all okay with a building being in such a fashion that we come in in the morning at 9 o'clock, we leave at 5, and at 5 we feel less healthy than when we came in. The air quality is just not really great. Now, if you have 32,000 sensors in a building, it's very easy to solve, because you can per floor or per square meter see, are people working here or are they not working here? Let's make sure that the air is going to the right places. Let's make sure that if the windows need to be opened or not opened, all these things can be done automatically, and it's going to be a huge game changer. Now, this is just a start. And the next phase is going to be even more important, because what happens if this is not happening on just one building? What happens if we do that over a whole city? Cities can be connected as well. And what we see today is that a building like the edge is producing probably 10% more energy than it's using. But that energy that is left over is then going back to the grid. But this grid was built in the 70s, and it's not an amazing grid. Now, if we would have a smart grid, then the building next to it can almost have a 100% efficiency in using that same energy that was used by the other building. But there are a lot more possibilities. One other possibility could be that if the building knows that there's a lot of meetings ending at five o'clock in the afternoon, that there's a high likelihood of a lot of Ubers being collected as well. And then with big data, the Uber people already know that that is going to happen, and they can be in front of the building instead of 10 minutes or 15 minutes later. So endless possibilities in a connected city. Has that been done before? Yes. This is a building that my company made in Rotterdam, and it's called a vertical city. And within the vertical city, we already experimented with having apartments, hotel, offices in one building, and we see that we can connect all these different functions in a building. Now, this is Berlin, and this is maybe the difficult part of my story. Why is it that all these buildings that you see in this picture are actually not sustainable? New buildings relatively easy to solve. All buildings, a lot of work has to be done. Now, basically the message I have here today is that the new technology and the big data possibilities that we have today allow us to change these existing buildings also into smart buildings. We just have to do a lot of work on it, and we need real estate people and the city to work together to make that happen. I started my talk to speak about Donald Trump and his art of the deal. It was a little bit of a joke, but there's also something serious. Technology is not the problem to make our cities carbon neutral. What we need is a deal, and I think somebody, somebody of you, should write a book, and it's going to be not the art of the deal, but it's going to be the art of the climate deal, because we need some sort of deal between the owners of real estate and the people who are governing our cities or our countries to make sure that a lot of action is taken. We have the obligation, and we can do it, to step in and make all these buildings and these 35% of carbon emissions coming from buildings going away. Thank you. you\n",

      "Transcription for Knitting Architecture： Be Smart about Building Concrete Structures ｜ Mariana Popescu ｜ TEDxBucharest.mp3:  So it's 2019 and we're all very much aware of the fact that climate change is a serious issue. Now if I were to ask everyone in this room to tell me what we should do to be more sustainable, we'd come up with the first things such as using less fossil fuels, flying less, maybe driving an electric car, maybe changing our diets, bringing our bags to the supermarket, using less plastic and recycling. And all of those are valid and good. But there is one sector we almost always overlook. And this sector in 2017 accounted for almost 40% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Can anyone think of what this is? It's the building and construction industry. And this is not going to get any better in the future, because by 2050 there will be 2.1 billion people more on the planet. So whether we like it or not, we're going to have to build housing and infrastructure for them. And if we do things the way we do today, we're going to be faced with more pollution, resource depletion, and a whole lot of waste. So at the Block Research Group at ETH Zurich, we developed methods to build and design buildings better. By intelligently including structural performance in architectural geometry, we can really reduce the amount of material that you need for a structure. And I can explain that easily using this piece of paper that I carried in here. So when it's flat, it can barely hold its own weight. But if we change the geometry and introduce a little bit of curvature, it can suddenly hold a lot more. And the amount of material has definitely not changed. Now it's the same principle that allows that Pringle to hold a full glass of water, and please try this at home. Also, it's the same principle that allows for this structure behind me to span 40 meters with only 6 centimeters of concrete. So if we do use structural geometry intelligently, we can design beautiful structures that use very little material. But there's a catch. Their geometries are usually complex and intricate, non-repetitive, and that means they can be very challenging to build using traditional techniques. Now concrete is the most used material not only here in Bucharest but the world. So it's also a favorite material when it comes to these kind of geometries. Simply put, because it's liquid stone, so we can mold it into whatever shape we want if we have a formwork. And the formwork is the catch. If we look at how things are being built today, unfortunately, we find a system that has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. This is roughly the 1960s, and while we've gotten better and more precise and more streamlined in our manufacturing process, the basic principle stays the same. We need months of milling or carpentry to produce these heavy, clunky molds that need a lot of support and ultimately turn into a pile of waste. So really, if we want to unlock the full potential of these kind of efficient and optimized structures, what we really need to do is not only change the way that we design things, but we also have to change the way that we build things. In terms of formwork, one solution of many would be to use a textile. A textile is a lot lighter than wood. It needs a lot less support, and finally, it's also more sustainable. It produces a lot less waste. My research specifically looks at how we could use knitted textiles as formwork for concrete, and knitting is very special in the sense that we can create 3D geometries directly in a single process using existing machinery, and we can also make sure that we have very precise local material properties or integrated features. And if it sounds confusing, I'll have you think of your shoes. Your sports shoes all do all of these things, and you're very familiar with them. So how this works is we start off with a design and then produce a fitting knitted textile. We then tension that textile into shape, and because textiles and especially knitted textiles are actually quite soft, so you wouldn't be able to hold their shapes when casting, we just coat them with a very thin, special cement paste to make them strong enough. This leads us to a nice, lightweight structure that can be now used as a formwork for concrete. One of the tricky parts here was designing or coming up with a computational pipeline that allows us to automatically translate a 3D design into manufacturing possibilities for a knitting machine, for existing machinery. So let me show you some examples. Of course, just because we start off and we say, hey, you know, knitting could work, that doesn't mean everybody believes it, so I started off with this knitting machine, which is something that people in the 90s may have had in their homes, and we lovingly called her grandma. Of course, because she's the ancestor. So we did a bridge. The first bridge we did was a small structure, something about as big as the circle I'm standing on today, but it was important to be able to test this kind of principle. It weighed only 200 kilos, but the interesting part about it was how much the formwork weighed, which was about one kilo in itself. So the way this worked, or the way we tried out, was we started with a textile that we tensioned using some splines and ribbons into a corrugated shape. We coated it with a cement paste I mentioned earlier, and then we used it to cast concrete into normally. If we look at the textile itself, you'll notice that it has already some channels in which we could introduce these bars, these black GFRP rods, and cables to get to the shape, and we also had some registry points so that we would know that we get the right thickness of concrete. To produce it, we used grandma. It took about a week in this very automated and not manual process. As you can see, robots were not yet coming for our jobs. To produce this very small textile in three pieces, because the width of the machine was also limited. Now what is very interesting about it is that it is very light. So the textile itself was only 433 grams in total. We put all of the pieces together into one single piece, introduced all of the splines and shaping elements so that we could get a corrugated shape in the end. That flattened piece of textile was then fixed into a rig, tensioned, and got into this shape. We took this lovely little bridge into a climate chamber and applied this thin cement-based coating I was telling you about. To get a shape that looks something like this and weighs only 12 kilos. Now this was one millimeter thick, and it could just support another four millimeters of concrete that we sprayed onto it. Those four millimeters together with the formwork from before became the formwork for casting concrete normally. So we didn't change anything about how we cast the concrete inside. The structure that came out may be small, but what it said about this kind of technique was that we can really create a rather heavy structure with a significantly lighter mold. Also, we didn't need support from underneath. So you could use such a technique to be able to build in places where you want to have an unobstructed passage, say over highway or over river. And of course, because we're researchers, what we also needed to do, we were eager to load test it dynamically and in a very scientific way. So we jumped on it. Now to the right, to my left in the picture, is Lex. And Lex is the researcher that works on making sure that the composition of the cement paste is exactly right so that it is strong enough to do these kind of things. So he's our in-house concrete magician. What the project also showed us is that the textile could possibly be used also in other ways. I mean, it wasn't coated on one side, so it remained visible and we leave it in place. So it kind of brings an avenue of doing something architecturally and aesthetically with something that is previously just meant for structure. Now those experiments were done with grandma. And you might say, hey, yeah, that's a great idea, but in construction we need to do things that are a lot bigger and spending a week on this two-meter thing is also not exactly ideal. So we left grandma aside because those experiments were convincing enough to get an upgrade to a proper industrial machine to see that this actually works at an architectural scale. So last year in October, we built a structure to test these things out. It was called Knit Candela and it was built in Mexico City. It was done in collaboration with Zaha Ditt's code group and it is designed as a homage to the famous shell builder Felix Candela. It looked something like this and what you already see is that it has a concrete outside and something interesting on the inside which is a textile. It weighed five tons of concrete in total so we went a long way from the 200 kilos and it was built using a cable net as a main load bearing structure and a knitted textile that weighed only 25 kilos. In total, the cable net and the textile were 55 kilos and they carried five tons. So that's quite impressive. To do this, what we did was we made a frame, we tensioned the textile into the frame using those cables that I talked about. But the interesting part here, just as with the bridge, is that the textile itself had all of the channels to guide those cables where they needed to be guided and another nifty feature, it had pockets so that we could insert inflatables. When inflated, those pockets would create cavities in the concrete, saving weight. What we did then is we coated it with a very thin cement paste with a slightly different formulation because we needed to use it outside and when that hardened, we coated it with concrete. When the concrete hardened, the frame can be removed and reused for other things and we're left with a structure. As before, the textile is left inside of the structure and it's what you see on the inside. It's this beautiful aesthetic thing. So in conclusion, the textile that we used had two sides, a beautiful aesthetic exterior that needed to be seen and a technical other side that needed to fulfill all the functions of guiding the cables and where all of these inflatables needed to be and for us to register the geometry. Even though they are two very different sides, they use two different materials and they behave very differently, they are produced on the machine in one single process. Now of course, the machine also has a limitation in its width, it's not long enough. So we did have to split the four meter geometry into four parts. But when we were done, we created what is arguably the world's largest scarf and we packed that up in four pieces and put it in our suitcases and took it in checked-in luggage to Mexico. Well, this is first to show that we can do this very lightly but also as architects, we finish everything the night before the deadline. So when we get to Mexico, we put everything together, we introduced all the cables where they needed to be and we stretched it in the frame. We also were very relieved to see that it does stretch to the size that we wanted because it looked incredibly small beforehand and that means that our pipeline and our whole system does work at least until this point so far. And what you can also notice is how little support it has. Otherwise you would need a whole lot of support to create this geometry. We then coated it with that thin cement-paste layer which was now misted on as a spray and we were left with this beautiful Swiss chocolate of a texture on one side. Now I just wanted to remind you that those little boxes that you see there of the Swiss chocolate, they're actually cavities in the concrete later on, making sure that we don't have as much weight otherwise in the structure. We then had very artful craftsmen, which are concrete workers in Mexico, that put three layers of concrete onto the surface in the most traditional fashion and made sure that it had an incredibly, incredibly smooth finish, which is absolutely mind-blowing to see that you get a concrete finish that probably Felix Candela would have also been proud of. So the finished structure has a hard concrete outside and a soft textile inside. What you don't see on this picture is that the textile is actually soft. You could lean against it, push, and it's soft because there are cavities behind it. And depending on how the sun would shine, every now and then you could also get a glimpse of the skeletons of little balloons that were in there. So I just wanted to leave you with a few thoughts about a process or a structure like this. The formwork for this was 50 square meters and the cable net and textile, so excluding that frame that can be reused, only cost 2,200 euros. It took, it was 25 kilos of weight that the textile had and we took it there in a checked luggage. It took a mere 36 hours to knit a surface area that would have taken about 750 hours to mill otherwise. And the entire project from the very first time we sat at a table for design to the structure standing there was three and a half months. That would have been impossible with traditional techniques because those 750 hours I mentioned earlier, that's about three months of milling alone. So that would have been just the formwork. Now finally, the really interesting part is that those machines that I'm talking about, they are, there are hundreds of them in factories such as these all over the world. So really we don't actually have to take the textile anywhere, though it's light and all that, we can just send them the data and have them manufactured locally. Moreover, these types of feats of economy and productivity are incredibly important for the construction sector. That is lagging behind other industries and the productivity is at the moment the same as it was 20 years ago, lagging behind average and definitely a lot lower than what manufacturing can do. So considering that in the next 30 years we would have to build the entire amount of construction that we have today, Bill Gates earlier this year likened that to adding a new York every month for the next 30 years. It's not that we can build less, but we should definitely be smarter about how we build and design those buildings. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcription for How we could make carbon-negative concrete ｜ Tom Schuler.mp3:  Concrete is all around us, but most of us don't even notice that it's there. We use concrete to build our roads, buildings, bridges, airports. It's everywhere. The only resource we use more than concrete is water. And with population growth and urbanization, we're going to need concrete more than ever. But there's a problem. Cement's the glue that holds concrete together. And to make cement, you burn limestone with other ingredients and a kiln at very high temperatures. One of the byproducts of that process is carbon dioxide, or CO2. For every ton of cement that's manufactured, almost a ton of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, the cement industry is the second largest industrial emitter of CO2, responsible for almost 8% of total global emissions. If we're going to solve global warming, innovation in both cement production and carbon utilization is absolutely necessary. Now to make concrete, you mix cement with stone, sand, and other ingredients, throw in a bunch of water, and then wait for it to harden or cure. With precast products like pavers and blocks, you might shoot steam into the curing chamber to try to accelerate the curing process. For buildings, roads, and bridges, we pour what's called ready-mix concrete into a mold on the job site and wait for it to cure over time. Now for over 50 years, scientists believe that if they cured concrete with CO2 instead of water, it would be more durable. But they were hamstrung by Portland cement's chemistry. You see, it likes to react with both water and CO2, and those conflicting chemistries just don't make for very good concrete. So we came up with a new cement chemistry. We used the same equipment and raw materials, but we used less limestone and we fired the kiln at a lower temperature, resulting in up to a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions. Our cement doesn't react with water. We cure our concrete with CO2, and we get that CO2 by capturing waste gas from industrial facilities like ammonia plants or ethanol plants that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. During curing, the chemical reaction with our cement breaks apart the CO2, capturing the carbon to make limestone, and that limestone is used to bind the concrete together. Now if a bridge made out of our concrete were ever demolished, there's no fear of the CO2 being emitted because it doesn't exist any longer. When you combine the emissions reduction during cement production with the CO2 consumption during concrete curing, we reduce cement's carbon footprint by up to 70%, and because we don't consume water, we also save trillions of liters of water. Now convincing a 2,000-year-old industry that hasn't evolved much over the last 200 years is not easy, but there are lots of new and existing industry players that are attacking that challenge. Our strategy is to ease adoption by seeking solutions that go beyond just sustainability. We use the same processes, raw material, and equipment that's used to make traditional concrete. But our new cement makes concrete that cured with CO2 that is stronger, more durable, lighter in color, and it cures in 24 hours instead of 28 days. Our new technology for ready mix is in testing and infrastructure applications, and we've pushed our research even further to develop a concrete that may become a carbon sink. That means that we will consume more CO2 than is emitted during cement production. Since we can't use CO2 gas at a construction site, we knew we had to deliver it to our concrete in either solid or liquid form. So we've been partnering with companies that are taking waste CO2 and transforming it into a useful family of chemicals like oxalic acid or citric acid, the same one you use in orange juice. When that acid reacts with our cement, we can pack in as much as four times more carbon into the concrete, making it carbon negative. That means that for a one kilometer road section, we would consume more CO2 than almost 100,000 trees do during one year. So thanks to chemistry and waste CO2, we're trying to convert the concrete industry, the second most used material on the planet, into a carbon sink for the planet. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribing The Beauty of Building With Mud and Trash ｜ Vinu Daniel ｜ TED.mp3 with Whisper...\n",
      "Transcription for The Beauty of Building With Mud and Trash ｜ Vinu Daniel ｜ TED.mp3:  The construction industry accounts for 30 to 40 percent of the world's total energy and resources. It also accounts for 40 percentage of the world's total carbon emission. A man who lived long before us gave us a very simple solution. And he is Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our nation India. He said that the ideal house should be built with materials found in a fine mild radius around the house. So we think, OK, what is that material? And it is right below our feet. It's mud. Now imagine if we can build a house with mud, there would be nothing more sustainable or eco-friendly than that. But then you might ask, how strong is mud? This compressed five percent cement added mud block made by my alma mater, Oroville Earth Institute, is twice as strong as a country fire brick. In fact, it has a dry compressive strength of 6.5 megapascal as compared to a normal fire brick which just has 3 to 3.5 megapascal. But then you may again ask, what about water? Wouldn't water destroy mud brick? This is a brick from the same institute kept in water since 1995, a little less than 30 years. And you can see that it can still hold a significant amount of load. So what does this tell us? Can we change our perception of construction? Can we imagine a new way of building or can we bring beauty to dirt? I demoted myself from being an architecture graduate to being that of a mason. Or maybe I promoted myself, I don't know. I joined hands with local workers and started teaching them mud techniques. Very soon, we started to change every aspects of our construction. Our foundations became pored earth or rammed earth. Our walls became mud blocks or compressed earth bricks. Why even our roofs became domes and walls made of mud bricks? This is a brick wall residence called Piruvith House, which we made in a very crowded community. So it goes in a zigzag pattern in need of natural ventilation. Now, please remember that this wonderful parametric form or curves were made not with any computational technology, AI or robotic arms. These were actually made with coconut twigs, thread and the mason's bare arms. At a time when the building industry is fast moving towards a future that exists mankind, we brought the value of human resources back into it. But way back in 2012, I was posed with a very life-altering question. I was asked to build a residence, a low-budget eco-friendly residence for a primary school teacher called Bijumathi. And when I reached the site, this was what I saw. A mountain of waste and debris dumped by the neighbors after they finished their construction, because there was no other empty plot. So what do I do? Do I stand back and allow this waste to be dumped elsewhere? Or do I reimagine the philosophy of building with materials found in my vicinity? Neither me nor the future generations can unsee the waste that is getting piled in our vicinity. Therefore, we decided to use this waste as a part of our construction technique. We hand pulverized this material, added a bit of soil and again 5% cement. And using the techniques we learned so far, we kind of poured it in between two meshes and poured the entire mixture into it. The resultant product was not just a formidable partition. It was load bearing, which means these walls took the load of the entire roof as well. But this came at a price. I was nicknamed Scrap Engineer by locals who found it amusing to see an engineer search through scrap in the junkyard. But what I found in the junkyard was pure gold. This is discarded electric meter boxes, washing machine wheels. Decaying wood all became part of a new philosophy that included more and more waste. Oh, thank you. Now, emboldened by this, our new aim was to build multi-storied mud and waste construction. Is that possible? Yes. This is Shigara, a three-storied, multi-storied mud and waste construction. We decided to further modify what we did in the Bijumethu residence. So instead of using two meshes, we put two wooden shutters and poured the same mixture, which we did in the earlier project. And the resultant product was as strong as before and economical too. This wall had a dry-compressy strength of 4.5 megapascal. And mind you, this building, this residence, we completed in a meager budget of $90,000 as compared to a general budget of $200,000 or more. Very soon, many practices in the country started adopting this technique, not just because of its eco-friendly part, but also because it was cost-effective. For us Indians, born to traditional societies, very often our dreams culminate in lavish weddings and festivals. This, by the way, is a wedding stage. But the very next day, this too is a common scene. India discards 3.6 million tons of plastic every year. Therefore, we decided to utilize plastic bottles as a part of our construction for a new project called Chuli. It's a housing project. And in this project, we started to build circular beams using plastic bottles and rain-force concrete and of course mud. We started to build it in circles. To be honest, we didn't know how this would eventually look like, but we still kept on building the circles. We made it stable and put a roof on top of it. You can see how weird this looks. But Chuli is a project that resides in a rocky terrain and is populated by a lot of trees and shrubs. Now generally, these two factors are attributed as very bad things for construction. People generally cut trees or clear them to make spaces for their rooms or buildings or whatever. But in here, the trees not only form shelter, but also cooled the building in a tropical climate. And as far as the terrain was concerned, generally people would fill it up, level it, clear it and build on top of it. But here, the building is perfectly camouflaged in the rocky terrain that 10 meters away from this project, you will not see it. That is how good it is camouflaged. In this project, we managed to use 4,300 plastic bottles which would have otherwise ended up as a landfill or even worse in the ocean. One day, we all got sick working at the site. We had breathing difficulty and we kind of went to the doctor. And the doctor very calmly said, ah, it must be the burning tires used in road construction. Stay away. And we were shocked. There are hundreds of kids who travel these roads every day to their schools. There are thousands of families who travel these roads every day to their jobs, while some of us even stay on these roads. And the answer is stay away. Upon further investigation, adding to our worst nightmare, we found out that our country discards half a million tires in a day. No, no, I'm not done yet. And the rest of the world discards another half a million tires to India on the same day. Yeah, this is an aerial peak of a tire dump seen from space. This is in a GCC country that collects the tires from all of you guys and eventually dumps it in countries like India. Now you should remember all of these tires, most of them at least, eventually end up either in the roadtowering illegal process or we end up burning it to make again fuel oil because this is a petroleum product. Now one way to neutralize this huge toxic threat is to use it as part of construction. Now inspired from architects like Michael Donoves and American, we introduce mud and tire to form a new building construction technique. And now we are building residences, we are building museums, schools, and this is the best way to neutralize this threat and create beautiful construction. We believe that tomorrow this may also be the alternative for the housing crisis that is a big reality for many of our underdeveloped countries. The heart of every project of ours lies with the problems that we created amongst us. Discarded tires, plastic bottles, construction debris. None of these things should be dumped thoughtlessly or carelessly. The world can not just find a solution but we can even find beauty in this disaster that we created for ourselves. I remember a single line by the poet of my native language, Ulur, and it goes like this. It translates to this, it is our choice whether to build heaven or hell on earth. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribing The Natural Building Blocks of Sustainable Architecture ｜ Michael Green ｜ TED.mp3 with Whisper...\n",
      "Transcription for The Natural Building Blocks of Sustainable Architecture ｜ Michael Green ｜ TED.mp3:  I live in big, beautiful British Columbia. And my life is fueled by exploring nature both at home and around the world. In fact, this is from the Himalaya just a few months ago when I was climbing there. Nature is a huge part of my life, and it inspires my creative and professional world as well. I work hard with my team, inspired by nature in Vancouver designing buildings. As an architecture practice, we have two main missions. Our first is to build a building. Our first mission is to focus on making beautiful buildings that serve our community and respond to the needs of the people within them. The second mission we have is focused on the fact that the first mission has a huge impact on the planet and on climate change, and we have to work to reduce it. As a result, our firm is often called a highly sustainable practice. And the truth is, it really isn't. In fact, I don't believe that word sustainable building or sustainable practice is really true in most cases. And the reason is the built environment uses an enormous amount of the world's resources, and far too few of those come from renewable resources. In fact, the vast majority of the material the man makes on Earth goes into the built environment. The other challenge with buildings is they represent about 39% of our greenhouse gas emissions, or in North America almost half of our greenhouse gas emissions. For reference, because it's not talked about enough, all of cars, planes, automobiles, the entire transportation sector combined represent only about 23%. So buildings are a huge part of the problem and not discussed enough. The reason for that are both the heating and cooling of buildings, of course, but also the materials that go into buildings. So when it comes to materials, the building structures, what holds the buildings up, really are composed of four major materials in every city on the planet, concrete, steel, masonry, and wood. And of those four materials, three of them have very, very high carbon footprints, in particular concrete and steel. Now wood is the only material on that list that's also a renewable resource, and sequester is carbon. So it's the only pathway as a material that actually can get us to carbon neutral buildings. And it's the pathway we choose in our practice to build all buildings. So our practice has been a timber-only practice since our inception. And as part of our advocacy for the use of wood in buildings, about 15 years ago I wrote a book called The Case for Tallwood Buildings. And that book taught the lesson of why we should do this and how we should do this. And in the beginning, it was a very unlikely concept that people had a hard time believing. And yes, we figured out that we could have built the Empire State Building entirely out of wood. That early idea now is a mainstream concept around the world in sustainable building practices. And there are hundreds of tallwood buildings that have either been built or are currently under design and construction, and thousands more to come. But wood, as a sustainable idea, is not sustainable unless it actually comes from sustainable forest practices. And much of the planet has forests that we actually need to keep standing as part of our climate solution. And in fact, lots of the world have forests that are under deep threat. If we think about where population in the world mostly resides and where it's growing the quickest, in fact, most of those areas either don't have forest or also are where these forests are threatened. And so wood, as good a solution as it is, and a solution that I still very much believe in, is not a global solution. Most of our cities are still built in those first three materials, steel, concrete, and masonry, and they have a high carbon footprint. And people are working hard to make concrete and steel better. But unfortunately, tweaking those existing materials is making them only modestly better. In the case of concrete, it's estimated they can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete at best between 10 and 35%. And that's a long way to go from where we need to be, either at carbon neutrality in our cities or better yet, in carbon sequester and carbon negative buildings. So how do we get there? After building about a million and a half square feet of mass timber, I don't believe in that material, but I keep asking myself this question. What is the alternative to the big four? And the answer in my mind without question is studying and understanding what's happening in nature and nature's structures, combining that with modern biotechnology, and combining that with all of the computer modeling that allows us to make incredibly efficient structures going forward. All those things together are creating what we call five. Five is a fifth way, a new structural material that will replace in my mind over time the big four. It's an all-organic material made from forests and crops that can be grown all over the world, strong and safe, and it eventually will be cost-effective and competitive against any other material available. Now, this isn't a new idea. Products made from natural materials, thankfully, are growing up everywhere. There's a huge industry of biomaterials in academia as well as in private business, and we're seeing new products come online every day. This community is strong and hopefully getting stronger, and our contribution to it is really focused on this idea of the biggest material use, which again is the building structure. So how does it work? So the idea is based on the same concept of how a tree works or any other vascular plant as we zoom in. A tree is sort of made of lignified tissues that go from the bottom of the tree to the top as our plants. And those lignified tissues have within them in the cell structure cellulose fibers and lignin that together make the plant strong in order to grow and thrive. And those two materials, the fiber in the plant as well as the lignin, as well as other binders, make up the ingredients of what we call five. Studying the fibers and how they work in plants is another part of how we're trying to make this structure. And if we all imagine cutting through a branch as the image just showed, we know that nature finds very efficient ways to create structures, and they're often round like a branch. But as humans, we tend to make boxy structures. And the reason we do that is concrete, steel, and these materials in wood are more efficient when we form them as a box or when we cut them as a box. It's more affordable, and that's why we see it. So a typical structure has columns and beams and a slab to make it up. And they're very boxy forms, as you can see in the image. Now, different structures behave very differently all the time. This particular structure is an example from a tall building, but if we were talking about a house, it would be a different structure. Or if we're talking about a hockey rink, it would be another structure. So just in this example, how do the forces work? Well, you have the force of the weight of people, and you have the force of the weight of the building above. You have wind blowing on the sides or an earthquake impacting it. The forces as they press down on this particular example in blue are forces of compression. That's the squeezing forces pushing down. And the forces here in yellow are the tension forces, the pulling apart on that structure. When we put those together, we see how the forces move to the ground through this simple frame, and it's sort of a flowing diagram. In fact, when we use what's called a structural stress plot, you can see that the form is very natural in its character. But as I said, we build things out of boxes. And when we overlap in our example, a boxy structure of wood, for example, we see these areas in red, which really are unnecessary. They're wasted material in the current way we build. In this example, working with our engineers, we actually calculated that this particular example would result in about a 27% material waste. Now, all buildings are different. It's very hard to make a sort of overall calculation. Some buildings are more efficient, some less efficient. But if we multiply this by the amount of building that needs to be built over the next 40 years for humanity, it's an incredible amount of human waste and poor use of our resources. So our goal with five is how do we use as little resources as possible? And when you use little resources in a building, and you lighten the building up, and a lighter building actually means that it weighs less on the ground, and our foundations below the ground can be lighter as well. So less resources equals lighter buildings, equals even less resources. Taking this idea of how five can be used less, we took four existing known solutions and put them together. The first is we take those plant fibers I described, and that can come from trees, that can come from plants, grass, bamboo. It can come from waste wood products. It can come from clearing the understory of a forest to make it less likely for forest fire in places like California. We take those fibers and combine them with other organic binders and lignin in order to sort of create a solid product. And then we take these computer models that allow us to really design efficiency into the way we build so we can boil out all that waste. And then finally, we're going to use custom robotics. That means that every part of a building, rather than being cookie cutter and the same and wasteful, can be just as much material as needed and no more in order to make the building safe. Together, that makes something that looks like this. And again, this is an example. The flat top is flat because we walk on floors, but underneath, the building looks more organic in its shape. And as you can see, these beams and columns feel a little bit more like branches and more like what we see in nature. As we zoom in even further, we start to see how it's actually composed. And you may think in your mind, is this fiber board, is this particle board, things you've seen before? Well, actually what we're talking about is a very microscopic layering of these plant fibers to just a millimeter long. By laying them together and cross-liminating them across each other, we can customize the way, based again on the structural model, exactly how the composition of each piece of the material works in order to make it as efficient as possible. We combine it with these organic polymers and lingon, and ultimately make this material as strong, dense, and behaves much like a tree would. Now, we do that in another unique way, in the way the forming works. Because no pieces of a structure have to be the same, and we want to reduce waste, we use robotic forms and fabric forms. The red is fabric that moves in and out and allows each piece of the building to be completely uniquely customizable. And again, we're using it to reduce the waste of a structure. Now, when we put that all together, it looks like something completely different, something that none of us have seen before. It's not like steel, it's not like concrete, it's not like wood. Instead, in this example, what you see is an entirely plant-based structure. It's healthy and beautiful to be around. Its shapes are not there as decoration, they're there as just structural essentials, and yet they're beautiful. It's safe to be within. It's sequestered as carbon, so it's part of our solution for climate change. I believe we cannot continue to work with broken systems and try to make them better. We have to imagine something next. We also can't wait for the world's resources to run out before we imagine a future that's different. We are no longer part of an industrial revolution of materials. We are at the beginning of Mother Nature's Revolution of Materials. And as a result, we can make much more beautiful environments for everyone. As I walk around the forest of my home, and I look up into the trees and imagine what the buildings of the future are, I imagine that they'll use less resources, they'll have less impact, they will still make strong, healthy communities for all of us. But they'll do so more efficiently. All of these ideas are ideas that already exist. There's nothing new here. We have an opportunity to live in a completely biological world. We just have to decide to do so. There is a community growing of companies and products of biomaterials that are available. And every day, there are new materials introduced into the system. We can and we will solve this combination of human need and the planet's need at the same time. All we need to do is listen to nature and let her teach us how. Thank you. APPLAUSE\n",

      "Transcription for Green buildings are more than brick and mortar ｜ Bryn Davidson ｜ TEDxRenfrewCollingwood.mp3:  So before we get things started, I wanted to take a quick survey. So hands up, who here lives or works in a building? Okay, it's an easy question. The reason I wanted to bring that up is that I would like to talk about the connection between buildings and climate change. And a lot of the discussion about climate change is very abstract. Ocean levels rising, a coal-fired power plant somewhere in the distance. But buildings are tangible. They're one of the few things that actually brings us all together that we share in common. But the problem with buildings, depending on how you slice it, is that they are contributing up to almost half of the greenhouse gas pollution that's contributing to climate change. So when we wake up in the morning, we turn on that shower, we go turn up the thermostat when it's cold, we plug in our laptop. All those actions are going through our building and somewhere that energy is creating that greenhouse gas pollution. So this is a problem. We can't address climate change without thinking about buildings. Now professionals around the world, people involved in green building, are trying to create greener options for the ways that we build. In fact, if you look at homes, you might think about what is a green home or an eco-home? And if you punch it into a search engine, you might get a bunch of images like this. You got this great house, really perfectly oriented to catch the sunshine, really thick insulated walls. In some cases, it might even have solar panels on the roof, something that we often refer to as green bling. It's been kind of tacked on there, but it does, you know, sometimes some great things in terms of producing energy. The challenge is that over the last 40 years, while we've been trying to create these green buildings, we've still seen this steady increase in global greenhouse gas pollution. So it starts to become evident that what we're doing isn't enough. A building like this, it's got the green features, it's got solar panels. It actually gets close to zero impact or net zero, but what we start to realize is we need something better. We need to go further. We actually need projects that can be net positive. Now to get to net positive, as we start to dig into this, we realize it's not enough to do just more of what we've been doing in the past, more solar panels, more insulation. What we need is actually a fundamental shift in the way we see and think about buildings. We can't just look at just the object or the thing, but we need to see the change that that thing creates in the world. It's only then that we can start to think about the positive change that we can have in addressing an issue like climate change. Now to dig into green buildings, first we've got to realize there's some pieces missing from the way we see and think about buildings. And because those pieces are missing, the way we set up categories and targets for green buildings are kind of pointing us in the wrong direction. But the good news is that there are actually a lot of great examples of net positive projects that are out there that we can learn from. And once we've kind of internalized those lessons, we can really figure out how to move forward. So to start off with, I want to talk about this really amazing building built in the early 80s by a fellow named Emery Levens. He's done a tremendous amount of work over the last 30 years in the field of sustainability. This building is incredible. It's super insulated, gets all its energy from the sun. In the middle of Colorado in the winter, they can go bananas on the inside with no energy input from the outside. So an incredible building that has influenced generations of designers like myself. But when you look at pictures of this project, there's always something that's missing. Just out of the frame of this amazing building is the building's parking lot. This great, amazing green building is located out in the middle of nowhere. So if you want to get there, you've got to drive. You want to drive miles. If you want to get a loaf of bread, you've got to drive miles. So this is a challenge that we have when we ignore the impact of location. Now let's look at it a different way. Say you've got the exact same green building, two different locations in the region. In one location, you can walk, you can bike, you have the option of taking transit. Another location, you have to drive. Maybe everybody in your family has to have a car. What this means is that this exact same building, the family on the right, may have two to three times the climate footprint of the family on the left. And this all has to do with where that building was located. Now kind of a cool way to visualize this is to go to walkscore.com where you can actually punch in an address and it gives you a score for how walkable that location is. So the green zone are areas where you have the option to walk or drive to take transit. The red zone, you're dependent on a car. And this impact of location is so profound that you might actually be better off living in a drafty old house in a walkable location than living in that super eco home out in the middle of nowhere. And this is profoundly different way of starting to think about what that building does. So when you look at the Leven's house, great. It uses one-tenth the energy of a typical house. That's amazing. But when you put back on the additional impact from transportation, the footprint is actually a little bit bigger than what we might have thought at first glance. Now there is another piece that we'll get to. I wanted to emphasize this bit about location with this little green icon, just so it's kind of seared in our brains that this importance of this location. But the next missing piece, which we get from this kind of hint of this great sort of landscape that this building is nestled in, is the question of what was there before? If it was a field, a farm, or a forest, that's what we would call a greenfield site. And on a greenfield site, nobody there was burning fossil fuels before you showed up. The squirrels weren't driving little cars or anything like that. There was no fossil fuel being burnt. So when we look at the change that this created from before to after, even though this is a super green building, it's having a negative impact on the climate. And this is where we have to start to think about this, because there's a magical way we can make this story better. If that new green building had replaced or renovated a drafty old building, it's a completely different story. All of a sudden we are reducing emissions and we've had a positive impact on the climate. So this is where we have the exact same building, but two very different stories in terms of how that building impacts the climate. So it's not enough to just say, it's a great building. We have to look at what was the change in the world that was created. And those are the pieces that are missing. We have to start asking, where is it located and what does it replace? And once we've done that, then we can start to set up better categories for how we benchmark buildings. Now if you're like me and you create buildings for a living and you're trying to be green, you like to see how many points do I get? Where is it rated? How do I stack up next to everybody else? So I've put together this sort of hierarchy of green building systems and they're all asking how good is your building? And the reason it's a pyramid is that at the bottom are all the old buildings. There's tons of them, way more. At the top are the green buildings, a relatively small amount. Now those green buildings, the lessons that are learned there trickle down through the building code and influence the way everything else is done. So it's not just a pyramid, it's almost like a wedge or an arrow. It's like pointing in the direction. This is how we are changing our entire city is by having this target. So when we look at green buildings, there's kind of two categories. The first is your typical green building like LEED. Maybe you're familiar with a building that's LEED gold. Any of these green systems, they're always rating that building relative to some typical building. This LEED home might be 30 or 50% better than a typical home of the same size. It's always this kind of abstract comparison. Now above that, if you want to do even better, you have this category of buildings that are actually striving to not just be 30% less bad or 50% less bad, but actually get down to zero impact. And there are a lot of amazing things that are now happening all around the world in this category. One of these systems, these sort of rating systems, is called passive house. I know, it's exciting. So with passive house, what a passive house is, is a building that's so well insulated, has such great windows, is so airtight that it doesn't need a central heating system. Even in the middle of winter, it can run off the heat of your body, heat from the sun, that's all it needs. And there's thousands of these things now being built around the world. Again, emphasizing with this little green icon that says passive house is all about the building envelope, the shell. The other piece is this green energy technology. So solar panels, windmills, the green bling that we can kind of tack on to any building. But if you put it onto a really good building like a passive house, you can actually get to net zero impact, where this building doesn't have a carbon impact like your typical building would. And this is, that's pretty great. That sounds like what we should be doing. But if we take a second and zoom out to the big picture, we go back and we look at that growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the last 40 years and think about what's going to happen going forward. Now of course, if we just build code minimum buildings, if we keep sprawling out building new code minimum buildings, those emissions just keep on going up. So what if we build everything to a lead gold standard or some other green rating system? We're still growing, but not as fast. We're being a little less bad. Now if we're net zero, every new building that gets built is net zero. We still are seeing, it's not getting us quite where we need to be because if we are expanding outward building onto green field sites, even if there's zero impact buildings, they are not zero impact. And all of this is quite substantially different from where we actually need to be going in terms of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. So what do we need? We need actually a new target at the top of this hierarchy, something better than net zero. It's what I'm going to call net positive. These are projects that are going beyond net zero to actually make a measurably positive impact on the world. But it's a different type of category. All these other green building systems say how good is your building? They're just looking at the thing. But net positive asks the question, how good is your building? Where is it located? What does it replace? Net positive is about the whole story. And this is the shift we have to make. So we have this toolbox or it's a lens, this kind of lens that we can now use to look at a project and ask the question, is this actually making a positive change? And fortunately there are great examples of this already happening. It's happening all around the world. We don't need new technology. We don't need a whole bunch of money. It's stuff we can do now. But let's look at how that actually starts to play out in practice. I'm going to go back to Amory Levin's house, an amazing house. We're going to look at this through the net positive lens. So to begin with, yes, great envelope, super windows, amazing shell of a building. But it's on a green field site, so we're not getting any credit for replacing an old building. And maybe perhaps worse, a walk score of zero. That's pretty bad. It's about as bad as it gets. So we are out in the middle of nowhere. So we have this kind of deficit and we can get to net positive. But we've got to make up with a whole lot of green bling, whole lot of solar to offset those additional impacts. So this idea of the green building that we've held in our mind is actually the hardest, most expensive way to get to net positive. And this is maybe where we need to shift away, because let's look at something quite different. This project maybe doesn't even look like a green building. What this is, is a renovation to a brownstone in Brooklyn. And it was renovated to the passive house standard. So if we look at this really cool thermal image, you've got all the old buildings that are just leaking heat out everywhere. And that heat is producing greenhouse gases. This building, it's not leaking heat. This is a radical transformation to an existing building. On top of that, walk score of 100. You have the option of living here without a car. If you move here from anywhere else in the country, you're going to be producing less pollution in your transportation. Now on top of that, this project is also cool. They renovated the existing brownstone, but they also did an addition on top. So not only were they renovating, but they were actually creating more living space, more living space for the families that were growing. And so what we have is before and after the existing building, the new building, this is a radically net positive project. And if we could just start doing this type of thing, we'd be well on our way to starting to address climate change. So we look at it through the lens, great building envelope, replaces an old building, walkable location. We don't need to do the solar panels, the windmills, all that other kind of stuff. The green bling, don't have to do it. We can do a project that's affordable, is something that we can do today, and have a positive change on the world. Now let's take those ideas back over to this coast. This is a project that our team is working on here in Vancouver. We've actually got two of these projects on the go right now. What this is is a passive house duplex. Walls are 17 inches thick, great windows. It's replacing an old bungalow. And in Vancouver, we're also able to build a little extra house, a laneway house, facing the alley. So we've gone from one unit of housing to three units of housing. This is the existing bungalow that it's replacing, and it's being done at a location with a great walk score. So there was one family. Now there's going to be two new families living there, and they're probably coming from somewhere where they drove more. So we're having a positive change on the transportation, but also the buildings. So one unit of housing to three, double the square footage on site, but still having a net positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Again looking at this project through the lens, great envelope, walkable location, replaces an old building, doesn't have to have the solar panels and other expensive features. So these have all been kind of small scale. I want to jump up a scale and say, okay, what about our downtown cores? This is a great, amazing project in Seattle called the Bullet Center. Five-story mixed-use office building has this kind of crazy hat, this kind of visor at the top, which is the solar array that powers the entire building. The reason it's five stories tall is because that's how tall they could go for the amount of sun that they could catch on their property. So this building produces all its own water, processes waste, does all these really cool things, but on top of that, it's got a great walk score. It replaces this old building, so we're getting a credit for taking away the emissions from this old building. And we're doing everything. This project, it's sort of version 1.0, but it shows us what's possible in our downtown cores. So we can do this. We can take this lens and realize that it's also a toolbox. We can pick different pieces. So if you've got a rural site, if you're downtown, if you're in a walkable neighborhood or not, there are ways that you can do net positive projects. We always start with a really good building envelope. We add the green bling as it's needed, but we also look really carefully at where is our project located. We often ignore this, but that is an incredibly important piece of it. And then asking the question, what does it replace? Because as a designer, when I see that green field site, it's so tempting. Great view, sunshine, I can totally design whatever I want to do. But as you start to think about what we need to do to be net positive, you realize these old buildings are actually gold mines of potential carbon reduction. And so now we actually hunt these out and we look and we say, how bad, oh, that building is really terrible? Oh, that's great. This is an opportunity to change things for the better. So this is where I'm trying to get at the shift. For the last 30 or 40 years, this idea of this standalone, self-sufficient building has been the direction we've been thinking about for green building. But we need a shift to something that's a little bit different in terms of our vision. Something that asks those three questions, how good is it, where is it located, what does it replace? Because then we can actually start to create a positive change in the world. Now as you go out, walk out the door today, go home, maybe you're not in the building industry, maybe you're a renter, that's okay. Go to walkscore.com, punch in your address and see what your walkscore is. Your choice of where you live, where you work is important. And if you can move to a better place with a higher walkscore, that's a profoundly net positive action and something that everybody here can do. Now if you are in the building industry or in any way connected to building projects, maybe you're in finance, maybe you're an urban planner, if you are an architect or engineer or a homeowner, you have the opportunity now to be a leader, to go beyond green buildings, to create projects that aren't just trying to be less bad, but actually make a positive contribution to the world. And I think you'll find that when you start doing that, it feels pretty damn good. Thanks. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcription for Why We Should Turn CO2 into Concrete ｜ Gabriel Falzone ｜ TEDxLagunaBlancaSchool.mp3:  Our lives are defined by the way we see the world. So let's reimagine, reimagine, and reimagine again. Hi everybody. So today I'm going to be introducing you to something that contributes to approximately 9% of the global carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. And I'm going to tell you how myself, my team, and researchers around the country and world are working to solve this problem. So what I'm talking about is something that you see every day. It's something that you walk on, something that you drive on, and something that you really rely on. But it might often go unnoticed. What I'm talking about is concrete. So what I have here is what's called a concrete masonry unit or a concrete block. Thanks everyone for bringing it up. They're a bit heavy. And this is something that you see in buildings all around you and in any kind of home improvement store. And although we see concrete every day, it really goes unnoticed in our lives. And because of that, you might not be aware that cement and concrete are responsible for almost one-tenth of the global carbon emissions every year. And this poses really a huge challenge to how society can reduce our climate impact. So how can something so mundane and kind of every day in common place as concrete be such a big problem and such a big deal in the battle for climate change? First, it's really important to get a sense of the scale at which concrete is produced every year. So concrete is actually the most used building material in the entire world with more than 20 billion tons produced every year. So that's around 5,000 pounds every year for every person on the planet. So for me, for you, everybody in this auditorium, 5,000 pounds of concrete are produced each year. That's second only in terms of materials that are produced and handled by humans. That's second only to water. So it's really kind of hard to imagine this level of concrete production that's available in the world. And this is more than any kind of other construction materials, be it glass, wood, or steel, or any other metal, and it's done so at the lowest cost. So why do we use so much concrete? There's a few main reasons. First, one thing is it's durable. So concrete can be used in applications where it's in contact with water and soil. So think of things like building foundations or bridges and dams. Other materials like steel and wood would either rot or rust away. And concrete can be produced really cheaply from materials that are abundant in the Earth's crust all around the world. This is really important, especially for the growth and development of infrastructure in developing countries around the world. So given that concrete is such a critical and widely used building material, let's take a minute to look at what it really is. What concrete is, is a mixture of cement, water, and aggregate. Aggregate is just a fancy word for sand and rocks. So the mixture of cement and water forms what's called a cement paste, and this cement paste acts like a glue binding those rocks together. When we mix these materials together, what you get is a fluid mixture that you can pour into a mold and then let set. The setting process turns it from a liquid material into a solid that becomes strong and then you can then drive on, etc. So it really is simple as to set it and forget it, and that's another reason why concrete is so popular. But because this process is so simple and kind of happens every day all around us, we might not know that there's actually kind of a lot of chemistry going on in this that makes this happen. So by mixing cement with water, we're actually starting a kind of complex chemical reaction called cement hydration. And what cement hydration does is turn the initial cement and water into more solids that then kind of connect together and bind together and then increase the strength of the material. So this can happen at any day kind of average conditions anywhere around the world without any special equipment. So that's really cool to be able to pour and have a real chemical reaction going on anywhere around us. So when construction workers are working pouring concrete on site, you might not think of them as this, but they're really like performing chemical reactions. So this is actually pretty amazing because if you take most any material, grind it up and mix it with water, you'll just make a big mess. Whereas cement is really special in this way. And how you get cement to be this special is to undergo a really interesting production process, and that's really where the majority of CO2 emissions from concrete come from. To make cement, you start by digging up materials from the earth's crust that have a lot of calcium, silicon, and oxygen. So these are mainly materials like limestone and different types of clay. These then get crushed up and mixed together. And then to convert these into cement, we have to undergo this high temperature process where they go into what's called a rotary kiln that you see here. So this happens at over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. So that takes a lot of energy and that comes from burning fuels. So that process in itself, you can imagine, emits a lot of CO2. But there's actually an even bigger source of CO2 emissions in this cement manufacturing. This is something called calcination of limestone. So that limestone that we added as a raw feed material actually contains CO2 within it. So we're really digging up stored carbon from the earth's crust and then heating it and releasing that CO2 directly as a gas. This is actually responsible for around 65% of CO2 emissions in the cement manufacturing process. And then all told, basically for every ton of cement that's produced, we have one ton of CO2 emitted in the atmosphere. So how can we go about reducing the CO2 emissions of concrete when the majority of them come from making cement? There have been a number of different kind of improvements to the sufficiency of this process. I'm looking at kind of better kiln designs and using different more efficient fuels. But these really do nothing to address the CO2 emissions from calcination. So there's a really huge gap in the available technologies to reduce CO2 emissions from this process. But what if we could really reinvent concrete? What if we could reimagine the way we produce this critical building material? And what if by doing so we could actually have a way to take up CO2 emissions from other industrial sources? Think of things like power plants, chemical refining. What would that look like? So it turns out it looks basically exactly like another concrete block. And that's by design. So this concrete block on the left is weighed with CO2. And it can fill the exact same performance and strength criteria as a normal concrete block. But the production of this block on your right emits actually less than 50% of the CO2 emissions of a standard block. And how this is possible is from a technology called CO2 mineralization. So CO2 mineralization is a bit of a mouthful. But basically what it means is turning this gaseous CO2 and converting it into a solid mineral state. And this is something that's permanent in any ambient conditions and won't be released in any standard timeline. So how this process works, first we start by identifying a source of CO2 emissions. For example, our current technology is looking at using flue gases from a coal-fired power plant, like the one you see here at number one. And second, we form concrete products using the same kind of standard methods used in any everyday concrete. But critically we replace the cement with another type of mineral called hydrated lime, which actually absorbs CO2 in this reaction. Third, and where the magic really happens, is in this curing chamber where the flue gas from the power plant is combined with the fresh concrete blocks. And that undergoes this reaction, taking up the CO2 from the gas stream and locking it away in that block. So the result is a concrete product with less than half the CO2 emissions and that can be ready to be used in a building. So the potential impact of this technology is really huge. If we're able to transition all of the concrete production globally to this method, we'll have a way to take up over 1 billion tons of CO2 every year into these products. That's cheaply, it's cheaply, efficiently, and from nearly any CO2 emitting facility. And we're right on the cusp of making this happen. In the research in my group, we've gone from making things a few grams to over 10 tons of concrete every day. And with green building becoming more and more important, with things like lead and living building challenge, there's many more options that give you a consumer the ability to choose low carbon alternatives and to make cities and infrastructure greener. So with our research and spreading the word to people like you, I really hope we can raise awareness about the challenge of concrete and turn this problem into a universal and scalable solution in the fight against climate change.
